# Walking the path

If you want the ultimate,&#x20;

you've got to be willing to pay the ultimate price.&#x20;

It's not tragic to die doing what you love.





You let someone else determine the direction your life took,&#x20;

that I judge.&#x20;

You can only be responsible for your own path and let others have theirs.







Nothing more than that you commit to your intent to free yourself.&#x20;

That you grant yourself the license to do whatever is necessary to realize your ambitions,&#x20;

at whatever risk to your alleged well-being and in full expectation of the solitude that will ensue.





All you have is your fire&#x20;

and the place you need to reach.&#x20;

Don't you ever tame your demons,&#x20;

but always keep them on a leash.





It is not our part to master all the tides of the world,&#x20;

but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set,&#x20;

uprooting evil in the fields that we know,&#x20;

so that those who live after may have clean earth to till.&#x20;

What weather they shall have is not ours to rule.







The silence strangles me.&#x20;

I almost turn back around.&#x20;

No one will notice if I take a day’s leave.&#x20;

No one will dare say I didn’t work hard enough.&#x20;

I yawn again.&#x20;

Maybe just a stretch today.&#x20;

Body could use it.&#x20;

Better to face tomorrow rested.&#x20;

I almost cave.&#x20;

But I know by now that voice of reason is the enemy.&#x20;

Inside me there is a coward who fears discomfort.&#x20;

That coward will offer solace in the form of excuses.&#x20;

But it is the coward who grooms a man for his defeats.&#x20;

The coward who makes him accept them because he is accustomed to finding a good reason to quit.&#x20;

The coward inside can only be killed one way.&#x20;

I toss down my pack and don my training kit.







Today is a good day to die, but the day is not yet over







Heed my words, Struggler.&#x20;

Soon a rain of blood, the likes of which you cannot imagine, shall fall down upon you.&#x20;

It will be a storm of death.&#x20;

But take heed, Struggler.&#x20;

Struggle, endure, contend.&#x20;

For that alone is the sword of one who defies death. Do not forget these words.
