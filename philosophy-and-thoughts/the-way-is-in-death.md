# The way is in death

Remember, the way of the warrior is found in death. Meditation on inevitable death should be performed daily. In every day when there is no battle, one should consider himself as dead. This is the substance of the way of the samurai. In the same vein, mastering your tools and environment is part of your continuous preparation for any challenge that may arise.
