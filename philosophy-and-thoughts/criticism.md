# Criticism

"I've been able to boil down almost all criticism from other people in my life to this statement 'You do not live in a way that I would prefer'      'You live your life in a way that I wouldn't prefer.' "



" Why aren't you going to be at this guy's \<insert social event> ?"

" Why are you still at work?"&#x20;

"It's time to stay focused. Molding and shaping and developing your ideas and your craft so that when it's time for you to make your rounds you gonna fly"

"I don't want to go back. I have to go back. I must go back."

"I'm a fucking piece of shit today. How the hell is this going to work out for me? And you fight that. And you fight that. You don't override it. There's no override button. It's the conversation in your head."

"And it's a choice. And that choice makes you misunderstood. It makes you crazy. And I'm going to have these people, these normal, everyday people, fat, lazy, exactly who I was judging me. Because I know it because I was once them."&#x20;

"Do you want to sit down and go back to that guy you once were? No. So this is what it takes."
