# Nightmares of Success

Sleeping soundly is for overtly homosexual men.

The world is at war, people are dying and BTC breaks a new ATH every day.

Money moving in every single direction, elections are overthrown in "democratic" nationsâ€¦

And you have ZERO innate anxiety?&#x20;

You close your eyes and become absolutely killable for a full 9 hours, without tossing, without turning, without any input from the outside world at all?&#x20;

You don't wake up in a sweat and instantly check the news?

You're not even rich, you're poor, and you're snoring?&#x20;

What are you dreaming of you fucking loser YOU HAVE NO MONEY.

Where is your warrior instinct? Where is your PTSD and your fear? Where is the adrenaline in your blood?

"Well why would I have PTSD" says the nobody.

Because if you were somebody you would take risks and the outcome of those risks would weigh heavy on your mind.

Your soul would be burnt with the stories of battles lost and the hope for battles you can win.

What kind of full-grown man DOESN'T have mental issues?

You feel no stress? None? You're napping? Like a kitten? Like a little cute kitty kat?

Are you comfy? Awww you're so comfy? Do you have a blanket?

You are gay.

"I had a nap" = Gay

"I was sleeping" = Gay

"He didn't wake up yet" = Gay.

I close my eyes but I never truly sleep.&#x20;

I'm tired but that's fine.

Life as a man is wanting food you don't eat.

And wanting sleep you CAN'T get.

Because your mind and soul are plagued by battles past present and future.

You think Putin sleeps well? Lol

Trump?

NO.

WINNERS OPERATE IN WAR MODE.

Nightmares are masculine. You should shoot awake with sweat multiple times a night.

Maybe then your woman would finally love you.

Instead, she wakes up to see you snoring and drooling, her movement didn't even rattle you.

She fully got out of bed and you're out cold because you're scum.

She could stab you in the neck and she considers it because you deserve it.

Killed by a girl because you were sleepy. Awwww.

The second I see a man who enjoys his sleep and acquires it with ease...

I know he's bitch made.

Sleep is what you give up once you become a hero.&#x20;

Peace of mind is for life's losers.

There is no debate.
