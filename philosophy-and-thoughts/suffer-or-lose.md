# Suffer or lose

Young Kings.

Pain is a requirement, it is the catalyst for Greatness.

Trump would not be moving like he is today,

If he won in 2020.

Trump would not be moving with such determination and confidence,

If they didn't try to lock him up, if they didn't slander him every day and if they didn't try to have him killed.

All the suffering, all the pain, all the tragedy,

It was a four-year test delivered to Trump by God himself,

Without the test,

He would not be who he is today.

He would not be moving like he moves today.

If you aspire for Greatness you WILL be tested.

You are likely in the middle of your test today and it will likely be many years until you receive the results.

Look at Trump if you need an assurance,

The pain and suffering you are currently facing is a requirement for greatness.

The test is a gift, it is by design meant to destroy you, it is meant to be impossible to pass by your current self.

It is the catalyst for greatness because you do not get through the test by staying the same normal weak man you are today.

You only pass these tests by becoming great.

And that only requires one action from you, every day.

FIGHT.
