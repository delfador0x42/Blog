# Being a father

The internet has opened up the battlefield of influence.

If you're a father, you are required to compete on this battlefield.

It's not enough to pay the bills and say "yes honey"

TIME spent with your kids does not equal IMPACT had on your kids.

You are raising your children's bodies while other people raise your children's MINDS.

You HAVE to become a superhero, you HAVE to outcompete for influence.

YOU CAN'T BE HOME ALL OF THE TIME.&#x20;

YOU MUST GO FIGHT WARS.

YOU MUST COME BACK HOME WITH IMPRESSIVE VICTORIES.

STORIES TO TELL, EXPERIENCES TO SHARE, WISDOM TO PASS DOWN.

The temporary absence is a price worth paying.

You cannot talk or explain your way out of this.

You cannot shun the arena and criticize the dirt on a gladiator's boots.

Adapt to the new reality.

Become a superhero or lose.
