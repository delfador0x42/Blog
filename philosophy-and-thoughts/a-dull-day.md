# A dull day

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day,&#x20;

you fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way.&#x20;

Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town,&#x20;

waiting for someone or something to show you the way.&#x20;

Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain.&#x20;

You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today.&#x20;

And then, one day you find, ten years have got behind you,&#x20;

no one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.
