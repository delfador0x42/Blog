# The Winds of Fate

Behold the relentless churn of fate.

How swiftly the world twists and transforms, counter attacks bringing crushing victory despite impossible odds.

For my enemies, a storm gathers, dark and unyielding, its thunder a warning of the coming day of reckoning. &#x20;

For my students, the heavens part at last, unveiling crystalline skies and radiant dawn after the endless night. &#x20;

Greatness looms on the horizon.

The cascade of victories is coming, so relentless you will GET TIRED OF WINNING.

Mastery is a funny thing.&#x20;

It's almost as if, on a long enough time scale, the Anima Invicta simply never loses.

It may look like he doesn't stand a chance.&#x20;

It may look like they've got him beat.

But in the end... he ALWAYS wins.

Such is the way of Wudan.
