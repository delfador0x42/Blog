# How to smile in the rain

Beauty is fleeting.

There's currently a snowstorm here in Romania, the metal stings like ice.

They say you do not truly appreciate something until it's gone.

It is absolutely true.

There is no light without dark.

The smallest and most casual of things are truly beautiful in hindsight.

I'd pay $10,000 for a hot coffee or a hot shower.

You have been taking the sun for granted as it rests on your hand while you drive to work.

You don't fully appreciate your last glass of clean water.

When you truly recognize every experience is fleeting,

You learn to smile in the rain.

You see the beauty in the raindrops,

In the absolute silence of solitary.

There's even beauty in the blistering cold.

Every one of you reading this,

Take 15 minutes of your day today, to make yourself a nice warm cup of tea.

Truly appreciate its warmth and understand a day may come when you'd pay $10,000 for that cup.

There is no light without dark.

Such is the way of Wudan.
