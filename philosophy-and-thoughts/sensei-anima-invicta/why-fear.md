# Why Fear

Fear is a feminine trait.

The Matrix tries to scare you,

A scared person is easily controlled.

Ask yourself the last time you felt FEAR,

The last time you truly worried,

Was there a knife coming for your throat?

Did men with masks and guns kick down your door?

Or,

Did the news say some words?

The lesson is not to never fear,

In some scenarios in life, the fear is justified.

But if you catch yourself afraid often.

If you find words you read on a screen to be scary.

Your mind has been highjacked.

You're a man who was turned into a woman,&#x20;

The mouse feels fear often&#x20;

The lion does not.

Be the lion.
