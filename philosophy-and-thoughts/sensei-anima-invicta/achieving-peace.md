# Achieving Peace

If you want attacks to stop,

You simply need to win.

Peace only comes from victory.

Peace will never come from stagnation.

And loss is simply death.

"Peace Treaties"

"Cease Fires"

These aren't real.

They are simply cold-wars, where bullets aren't fired but the stress doesn't go away.

The problem hovers on the peripheral waiting to be dealt with, sooner or later.

That's not peaceful.

So the stress doesn't leave you, it just migrates to preparation.

When you have a fight coming up, the stress isn't gone.

The stress only disappears once you've WON your fight.

No one calls Trump a rapist anymore,

No one calls Trump a con artist or criminal anymore.

His enemies have stopped.

Why?

Because he WON.

If you want the war to end, if you want your struggles to vanish.

Then you need to win.

In the heat of battle...

Are you tired? Hurt? Struggling to carry on?

You can rest if you KO your opponent.

Otherwise, you are stuck fighting.

Do you understand?
