# Fight to Fight

An important message to most of you reading this.

You are the kind of man who would just roll over and die.

When the enemy places his hands around your neck...

you'll squirm a little, you'll fight a bit, but once you're tired...&#x20;

once you realize it's hopeless...

You lay still waiting for black.

I know this is true because your life is a testament to your inability to perma resist the crushing forces of the universe.

When you are lined up against the wall to be shot.

You put on a sad face. You say please. You beg for mercy.&#x20;

"Maybe they will see I'm sad and not shoot me?"

A pathetic ending to a pathetic man with a pathetic mindset.

Men like me?

We charge at the firing squad.&#x20;

We run at the guns with murderous intent and no hope.

We die fighting.

I do not pray for, hope for, or believe in the concept of mercy from an enemy.

I fight tooth and nail.

I resist to the last possible seconds of consciousness in all realms.

The chance of me avoiding bullets from all 5 soldiers, killing them all, obtaining a weapon and making it out of the army base alive are practically zero.

Winning? Lol.

Winning has nothing to do with it.

I don't fight to win.

I fight to fight.&#x20;

That is why I win.

You are the type of man who only considers fighting with winning as an option.

EVEN WORSE

You are the type of man who considers fighting only when winning is CERTAIN.

And you are STILL afraid.

Winning? Losing?

This is a by-product.&#x20;

This is besides the point.

THE POINT IS TO STRUGGLE UNTIL MY LAST BREATH.

Do you understand?
