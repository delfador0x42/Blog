# Lessons from Scarcity

Caffeine is a miracle.

Nearly 30 days stuck inside this dungeon and I've learned some truths about life.

Nearly 30 days without a single drop of caffeine and I can tell you that a caffeinated life is a better life.

Nothing GOOD has come from my lack of caffeine.&#x20;

My days are slightly less alert but it's no easier for me to fall asleep every night.

Coffee powered the entire industrial age.

The coffee break became a staple in business because a caffeinated business outcompetes a non-caffeinated business.

Remember this whenever you see some nerd order decaf coffee.

I'm perspicacious enough to monitor the results a lack of caffeine has brought to my life.

There is no advantage.

Start your morning with TWO plain black coffees and conquer your day.

Don't listen to the psy-op saying two coffees in the morning is bad for you.

The Matrix wants you weak, poor, and alone.

I communicate my lessons to you so that you may become strong, rich, and surrounded by brothers.

Empowerment of the average man is my only crime.

Start your mornings caffeinated.

Such is the Way of Wudan.
