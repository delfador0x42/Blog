# A Lesson from Jail #3

Jail is a fantastic way to see who is actually on your team.

Most men in here have phone calls but no one to call.

No letters to read.

All of them have a family.

Every inmate had some friends.

But Jail is a strong test.

And most men chose their team poorly.

They failed.

Every one of you reading this,

Ask yourself.

How would your team perform if you were imprisoned?

If they would perform poorly.

Work to change that.

You cannot be rolling with cowards.

Everyone has friends when the sun shines.

But you will need your friends most when it rains.

You cannot conquer the world alone.

I will emerge from jail as a better person.

But a better person needs better people.

My team may be enjoying freedom,

But the burden to increase in diligence, competence and professionalism is shared by us all.

Such is The Way of Wudan
