# The Worst of Prison

I've often been asked what was the worst part of prison,

And my answer surprises the unaware.

The greatest burden of prison was being robbed of man's greatest superpower.

Every one of you reading this has the freedom to channel all of your emotions into positive action.

If you're too stressed to sleep? Work.

Depressed about your situation? Change it.

Angry your girl left you? Go to the Gym.

Every one of your emotions can be channeled into positive action in the world.

Every emotion is simply fuel to propel you to the highest of success.

Therefore, there are no real BAD emotions.

Only bad use of emotions.

In prison, you get all the fuel, but limited outlets.

In fact, you often get MORE fuel than the outside world.

Luckily - pushups are always there.

They never abandon you.

I see people abandon them, and then lose their minds.

It's amazing how, sooner or later, laziness leads to decay in all realms.

This is your reminder not to waste the fuel you are given.

Use all emotions to become great.

Happy? You're happy to work.

Mad? You're angry enough to force change.

Depressed? You really need a change, time to work.

The list goes on.

IT ALWAYS LEADS TO WORK.

Such is the Way of Wudan.
