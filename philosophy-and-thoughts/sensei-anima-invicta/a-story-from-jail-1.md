# A Story from Jail #1

I will send you my daily lessons from unjust imprisonment.

They are trying to break me.

Thrown inside a cell without light.&#x20;

Cockroaches, lice, and bed bugs are my only friends at night.

When the guards bring me to and from the courtroom, I stay absolutely respectful.

They try to pour hatred into my heart.

But Please and Thank You stick with me at all times.

My prison guards are just performing their job, they have families to feed.

In times of hardship, do not forget your manners.

They are trying to break my Iron Mind with unjust imprisonment.

My absolute respect for everyone around me is my act of absolute rebellion.

They cannot break me.

My guards know I am innocent.

They know it is unjust.

They see I will never break and respect my resolve.

Please and Thank You stick with me at all times.



Such is the Way of Wudan.
