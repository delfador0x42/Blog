# Scariest Thing about Jail

I felt the earthquake last night.

One of the scariest things about jail,

Is the concept of an earthquake or fire because you cannot run.

Your movements are confined to a small space.

They have placed metal doors and obstacles in your way.

For most, it would be impossible to escape.

They would simply need to accept their fate,

For me, I am very concerned about the time it would take.

In a life or death situation,

I fear my Shotokan would puncture the steel doors in time.

I will use this fear to train harder than usual.

Such is the Way of Wudan.
