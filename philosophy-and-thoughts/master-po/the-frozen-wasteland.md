# The Frozen Wasteland

Po traveled alone through the forest in a harsh winter, he reached a snow-covered clearing.

In the clearing stood the largest tiger in the known world, his name was Jin.

Through snarling teeth and frozen breath, the tiger and Po held locked eyes. Bitter wind tore through the trees.

A few seconds passed, and silently, a mutual agreement was made. Both Jin and Po were hungry, yet food was not the most pressing concern.

They were smart enough to understand that the true enemy was cold. They would huddle together for warmth to survive the night - and fight the following day.

When they awoke the next morning, Po said only two words before inviting Jin's attack.

The words spoken have never been disclosed - yet they inspired peace. The tiger agreed to become Po's pet, and they traveled the frozen wasteland together from there on out.

Sleeping together for warmth at night, and hunting together during the day.

When they returned to civilization, many people asked: "Do you not fear the tiger? What if he turns on you? Strikes your neck as you sleep? He doesn't need you for warmth anymore..."

Po replied: "Why would he do that? Jin has no wish to die."

Such is the Way of Wudan.
