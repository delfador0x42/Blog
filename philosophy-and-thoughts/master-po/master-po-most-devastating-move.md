# Master Po: Most devastating move

Leave them in the cold to heal. Ready for the next massacre.

Master Po would disable them at will, abolishing hundreds with fast strikes and unorthodox technique.

I could hold my own against one or two, but my skills had not yet matured.

In the middle of combat, I grew frustrated and how difficult it was for me. Too many close calls.

Too many mistakes.

It simply took me too long for each victory. I needed more power.

Hurriedly, as I ripped the throat from a spirit - I shouted:

"Master!! Please. I need power. Show me the most devastating move you know!"

Po, while crushing the skull of a downed opponent, replied:

"You could never execute it. You’re weak."

This bothered me. I did not want my Master to think I was weak.

As I continued to battle I attempted to show Master that I was strong. That I COULD execute any move he taught me.

Through anger, my Kagi Tsuki grew wild and inaccurate, my Kiai rushed.

Suddenly, a Dragon kick knocked me to the ground. I spun and raised my hands to protect my face.

I saw the sword raised, my decapitation imminent.

I froze.

Masters flawlessly Shuto Uchi ripped the spirit's arms from his body before he could take my life.

Armless, the spirit screamed. Feeling real pain.

Then Po's fingers ripped his eyes from his skull.

Blind and in agony, yet unable to die, he ran screaming into the darkness.

At this, I was dragged to my feet, and we fled the field. Leaving a trail of destruction behind us.

The ghosts were in pieces.

The battle was over.

The walk back to Wudan was embarrassing.

I was adept number 1.

And yet, I failed. I died. And he saved me.

To be saved by Po was an honor, he had a habit of simply letting people die for their mistakes, but I didn’t feel honor.

I felt shame.

I expected more of myself.

I was disappointed. I needed to learn more.

I asked:

"Master, if I can not execute your most powerful move, will you at least show it to me?"

Staring straight ahead.

He whispered...

"I’ve shown you already. Using only my tongue, I broke your Zen."
