# Carrying Thoughts

For the first 1000 years atop Wudan mountain,&#x20;

I was tasked with fetching water from the stream at its base.

The walk would take many days,&#x20;

and occasionally Master Po would accompany me and ask me questions about Zen.

This particular night, as we approached the stream,&#x20;

stood the most beautiful girl I have ever seen.

She was standing,&#x20;

unable to cross a puddle of mud in fear of staining her Pearl silk robe.

I was always warned to stay away from beautiful women.&#x20;

They distract you from inner rage.

They tame your soul with sparkling eyes&#x20;

and it is impossible to be completely lethal when indulging in their beauty.

Therefore for the next 4000 years of training,&#x20;

I would never feel a woman’s touch.&#x20;

As supreme grandmaster of Wudan mountain, Master Po’s desire for women died many thousand years before.

She screamed out to us for help,&#x20;

and without a smile or saying a word,&#x20;

Master Po helped her across the mud and she was on her way.

I contemplated for many years before I finally spoke out:&#x20;

“Master! It was only mud, she could have crossed herself. She was lazy and vain.&#x20;

Why did you carry her?“

He smiled and replied:&#x20;

“It has been all those years while she has plagued your thoughts&#x20;

and you think you have not carried her?“



Such is The Way Of Wudan
