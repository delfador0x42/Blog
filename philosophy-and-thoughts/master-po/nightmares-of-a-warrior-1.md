# Nightmares of a Warrior

On my 407th year atop Wudan began a period of terrible nightmares.&#x20;

Scenes of death and destruction.

I did not sleep for 20 human years.

Despite embarrassment, I sought the council of Master Po.

“Master. You teach me the hidden styles of Wudan, in a bid to make me a great warrior.&#x20;

Yet I can not sleep due to the sight of death, of destruction.&#x20;

I feel uneasy. I simply lie awake.”

He replied in a whisper:

“You feel awake... alive, at the sight of battle, and you doubt your skills as a warrior?”

&#x20;

Such is The Way Of Wudan
