# Nightmares of a warrior

On my 407th year atop Wudan began a period of terrible nightmares. Scenes of death and destruction.

I did not sleep for 20 human years.

Despite embarrassment, I sought the counsel of Master Po.

"Master. You teach me the hidden styles of Wudan, in a bid to make me a great warrior.&#x20;

Yet I cannot sleep due to the sight of death, of destruction. I feel uneasy. I simply lie awake."

He replied in a whisper:

"You feel awake... alive, at the sight of battle, and you doubt your skills as a warrior?"

&#x20;

Such is The Way Of Wudan
