# The Sun Faded, The Day Vanished

Master Po was very critical.

It is difficult to not be pessimistic, when you are eternally correct.

Of all my time atop Wudan, I struggle to think of a conversation that took place without him correcting someone, or something.

Po had a particular dislike for dreams, which always confused myself and the other adepts.&#x20;

Each morning he would line us up, and force us to tell him what we dreamt of the night before.&#x20;

He would often interrupt loudly and visibly angry.

On this particular morning he started with me.&#x20;

He pointed, and I began to speak.&#x20;

"In my dream, I saw three trees. Each different colors. You were there and ordered me to climb the red one, but when I approached it, it became blue..."&#x20;

I began.

He interrupted me. "Inaccurate and imprecise!" he screamed.&#x20;

He struck me hard in the face before pointing at the next adept.

This reprimand was particularly upsetting, as his accurate insults left me in a difficult position.&#x20;

I struggle to think of any dream, had by anyone, which was neither inaccurate or imprecise.&#x20;

The following morning he once again pointed at me to recite my dream.

Surrendering to further beating, I began to speak exactly as before. "Last night, I dreamt I was on a cloud, high atop the temple.

It was early morning, and as all of the other students stood exercising, I sat atop this cloud and simply watched."

Po's expression did not change.&#x20;

"So you dream of mastery?" He ushered me over to the exercise floor. "Only practice breeds mastery, not dreams."

I walked over, and began my forms. Atop Wudan we had 7 basic forms, a demonstration of the 7 Wudan styles. Po stood and watched me without moving.

A few hours later, after reciting every form, I looked over to Po for instruction, but he did not move or speak.&#x20;

Unsure what to do, I simply started again.

Hours passed. The Sun faded and the day finished.

The darkness came and went. I had practiced all throughout the night and was well into the afternoon of the following day.&#x20;

Po was still standing in the exact same position, even the wind which shook the trees did not dare ruffle the fabric of his robe.

He was perfect stillness. Resisting exhaustion, I continued to train. Until deep in the next night I heard Po shout: "Enough!"

I had not had a moment's rest for two days. Not a sip of water. Reciting forms in the summer sun had left my mouth so dry I was unable to speak.

The only force which kept me going was the fear of Po's punishment for stopping before I was told.

I drank a large cup of water and went straight to bed, I slept a full 3 hours before the 5 am wakeup call.&#x20;

It felt as if only a minute had passed.

I was so tired, I remember only darkness. As we stood in a line, PO once again pointed at me to begin reciting the story of my dreams from the night before.

For the first time since my ascent to Wudan, I had not dreamed anything.

"I did not dream last night, I was so tired. I don't remember anything but black," I said to Po.

He didn't reply. Simply pointed at the next adept.
