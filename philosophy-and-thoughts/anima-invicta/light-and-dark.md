# Light and Dark

Bugattis and private jets.

Romanian solitary confinement.

Very different ends of the spectrum.

But both are extraordinary.

I've always strived for an extraordinary life, I am not a coward, and thank God for every waking day.

Do you strive for an extraordinary life?

There is no light without dark.

Every heroâ€™s journey has struggles and pain.

The Iron Mind is the one who can appreciate and smile in the darkness because he knows it makes the light so much sweeter.

Whatever struggle you are going through.

Enjoy it.

If what you wanted was easy, it wouldn't hold value.

There is no light without dark.



Such is the Way of Wudan.
