# The art of NEVER LOSE

Master the art of NEVER LOSE.

Every single loss on earth can be turned into a win.

Every defeat flipped into a victory.

You need to become an expert at adaptation.

You need to become THE BORG.

When life shoots you with a weapon, you need to make sure it only hurts once and can never happen again.

You need to USE YOUR BRAIN.

A superpower that 99.9% of men on this planet have never learned to do.

Got sucker punched?

Why? How? What mistake did you make? How do you prevent it from ever happening again?

Lost a client?

Why? How?

Lost your girl?

WHY? HOW?

It's not bad luck, it's not random, it WAS YOUR FAULT and if you do not learn from it, it will happen AGAIN.

Most men never learn.

Some men learn after a few mistakes.

You need to learn after ONE mistake.

Master the art of never losing, make each bullet that pierces your skin only STRENGTHEN YOUR POWERS.

Such is the Way of Wudan.
