# War is Inevitable

War is the only constant of life.

Pain, misery and suffering can never be permanently avoided.

One day, a loved one of yours will die.

One day, an economic downturn will hit your business.

One day, your country could fall to civil unrest.

PAIN is inevitable.

STRUGGLE is guaranteed.

If you are a man who loves or wants, you are cursed with an inevitability of struggle and strife.

This is the cold hard reality of life.

The answer to this curse isn't to want less or love less.

That is the cowardâ€™s way out.

The answer is to become GOOD at suffering.

Capable and headstrong in the chaos of the storm.

You need to aspire to become the man who when pushed to the pits of hell stays composed and capable under pressure.

The indomitable man.

The storms are inevitable.

Aspire to become the man who performs outstandingly in the rain.

Such is The Way of Wudan
