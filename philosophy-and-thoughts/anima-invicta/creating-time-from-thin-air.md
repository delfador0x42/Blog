# Creating Time from Thin Air

The best thing you can do for your own life is to make sure everyone around you is better.

Every single person you've ever contacted,&#x20;

Every single person you've ever seen,

Your life would be better if they were rich, strong, happy and good-hearted.

If you could spend 1 minute of your time to save 15 minutes of another man's time.

You have CREATED 14 minutes.

CREATED TIME.

Do this perpetually,

Do this constantly,

And watch those CREATED minutes find their way back to you.

You would live in an abundant reality overflowing with created time.

You are so "unlucky" in life because you've never CREATED time.

Instead, you perpetually DESTROY it.

So selfish, that you would trade 20 minutes of someone else's time to save yourself 5 minutes of your own.

Shortsided,

Net-negative,

Destructive.

And all that destruction leads to a scarce world you live in.

A dog-eat-dog world, where everyone around you is desperate and willing to damage you to better themselves.

Win-lose is all you and everyone around you know

Because it's all you spread.

I am a billionaire.

I do not need to take my time to write these emails for you.

I lose 20 minutes.

But while I may lose time to do this, I know that YOU will learn something new.

You learn something which would've taken you hundreds of hours of life experience to come up with it on your own.

Writing these emails, I create MILLIONS of minutes every day.

I create a world full of abundance,

And it's common sense that somehow some of those minutes will flow back my way.

A positive spiral.

Giving is the source of all creation.

Such is the Way of Wudan.
