# Words mean nothing

Undeserved Ego and Arrogance will guarantee an eternal place in loserdom.

Too many of you reading this try to emulate my brilliance through WORDS.

You see me call losers losers.

You see my supreme confidence in myself and you try to emulate it.

But you have not done what I have done.

My ego is EARNED.

My confidence is EARNED.

When I tell you I am better than you in EVERY HUMAN METRIC, it is not arrogance, it is an objective FACT.

It is no more arrogant than telling you water is wet.

I acquired my powers from 10,000 years of humble servitude upon Wudan.

Absolute obedience to Master Po.

If I was told to climb, I climbed.

If I was told to jump, I jumped.

If I must spend the first 5,000 years in the Lotus position.

I DID IT.

NO QUESTIONS.

ONLY ACTION.

I have done what you have not done.

I have done what you WILL not do.

Through pain too great for any other man to bear, I have turned myself into God’s favorite creation.

You do not get here with talk.

You do not get here being “too smart” to listen.

You get here through absolute obedience.
