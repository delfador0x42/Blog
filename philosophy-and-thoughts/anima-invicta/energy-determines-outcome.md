# Energy determines Outcome

Energy determines productivity.

There are no low-energy wealthy countries.

They don't exist.

It's obvious to see and everyone knows it's true.

But the less obvious fact of life is,

That there are no low-energy wealthy PEOPLE.

Your wealth and quality of your life are DIRECTLY correlated to how much energy you spend per day.

Trying to "conserve energy" is keeping you poor.

MORE output,

MORE work,

MORE energy.

Doesn't matter if you're tired, FORCE the output then.

Adapt to a high-energy lifestyle.

Make it HARD to NOT be rich.

Spend more energy, do more.
