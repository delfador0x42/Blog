# The greatest burden in prison

The greatest burden in prison is being robbed of man's greatest superpower.

Every one of you reading this has the freedom to channel all of your emotions into positive action.

If you're too stressed to sleep? Work.

Depressed about your situation? Change it.

Angry your girl left you? Go to the Gym.

Every one of your emotions can be channeled into positive action in the world.

Every emotion is fuel to propel you to the highest points of success.

You have the freedom to work, unlimited access to the outside world and emotions to fuel your actions.

In prison, you have all the fuel, but limited outlets.

You're on the outside with unlimited freedom.

This is a reminder not to waste the fuel you are given.

Use your natural emotions to become great.



Such is the Way of Wudan.
