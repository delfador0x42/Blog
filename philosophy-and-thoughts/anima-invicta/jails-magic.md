# Jail's Magic

An unexpected side effect of unjust imprisonment is making more money than ever before.

For the first time in my recent adult life, I have time.

THE WAR ROOM Network has my life completely in order while I'm unjustly detained.

I have brothers on the outside who have taken on my responsibilities.

I am left with TIME.

And TIME is the magic ingredient.

I turned time into more money.

You are not as busy as I was, you have the magic ingredient.

If I can make more money inside jail.

You can make more money outside of jail.

Make a plan.

Execute.

Every dream you aspire towards is yours, you have TIME.

Use it.

If you don't have a good plan?

Make one.

Such is the Way of Wudan
