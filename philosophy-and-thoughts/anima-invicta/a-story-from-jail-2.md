# A Story from Jail #2

There is one story that visits me very often in this cell.

Atop Wudan in the year 109, Master Po took me to the cliff’s edge.&#x20;

“The first lesson in Zen is about mortality,” he said.

“When you reach my level of power, you know exactly when you will die.”

He produced a handful of pink apple blossoms from his robe and threw them into the wind - they floated upon the breeze, scattering into the valley two miles below.

“Retrieve every last blossom.&#x20;

And when you have picked up the very last one, you will know that I have passed to the next life.”

I bowed and shed a tear.

Then began my walk down the mountain.

I found the first blossom two weeks later.

Laying in a rock pool, bright pink contrasting violet blue.

I lived in the wilderness, hunting wolves with handmade weapons, and spent every waking hour searching for the blossoms.

I had no desire to hasten his passing, yet I understood to always obey.&#x20;

After 21 years, I had found 99 of the 100 blossoms.

I had walked over 3000 miles through wilderness.

The mountain winds had blown them far and wide.

I spent another 60 years, looking for the final piece.

I would meditate at night to keep frustration at bay and spend my days sifting through dirt,&#x20;

climbing trees and swimming lakes - knowing the blossom could be anywhere.

The final blossom eluded me.

I dreamt of it. I hallucinated. I saw it permanently in my mind, but could never find it.

And then... 81 years after first descending from the mountain, I came across a large flat rock.

Upon it was the perfect imprint of an apple blossom.&#x20;

The piece must have landed here many years ago, and the blistering sun had all but obliterated it - leaving nothing but the perfect print on hard stone.

I was furious.

So many years wasted. Elements endured.&#x20;

And it’s now clear, I could never complete the task.

I returned to Wudan with 99 blossoms to find Po meditating.

I knelt before him and began to cry through frustration.

“I have failed. I did not move quickly enough for the sun. I will never have all of the blossoms.”

He smiled and replied. “Then I will never die.”

Such is The Way Of Wudan
