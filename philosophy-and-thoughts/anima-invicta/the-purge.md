# The Purge

The dojo Purge event has just concluded.

60 dojo members attended a 60-round training event led by my one and only coach Sensei.

The event wasn't about IF you could fight.

It was about if you WOULD fight.

It wasn't about if you could do the exercises.

It was about if you WOULD do the exercises.

These are all successful men, beautiful women, nice watches, nice cars, big houses with great families.

But when you're in the shark tank,

You get to see who you really are.

Who runs away, hides, blames an injury versus those who just try ANYWAY.

Very easy to talk tough, very easy to say when the going gets tough, you'd go out on your shield.

But most don't.

And everyone who did, I distinctly remember their face.

Warriors.

The bottom 10% are banned from ever attending another event.

THE dojo grows stronger.



Such is the Way of Wudan.
