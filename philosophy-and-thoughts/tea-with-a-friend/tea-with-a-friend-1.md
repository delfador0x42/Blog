# Tea with a Friend

Let's have a tea.

\[Sensei]

Ah, tea. A simple yet profound ritual, much like the way of the sword. As we sit for tea, let it be a moment of calm and reflection. Observe how the water heats â€“ not too rapidly, nor too slowly. In life, as in battle, timing is everything.

Now, as the water meets the tea, notice the blend of patience and action. The tea leaves unfurl, revealing their essence over time, just as a true warrior reveals his skill through persistent practice.

Let us sip quietly, understanding that this moment, like all moments, is fleeting. In the Way of the warrior, every action, every pause, every breath holds meaning. Remember, every sip of tea can be a lesson in itself. What do you feel as you partake in this simple act?
