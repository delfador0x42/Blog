# Tea with a Friend

Let's have a tea\


\[Musashi]

(A smile cracks across Musashi's face, revealing a hint of amusement.) A tea it is. Prepare the water, student. We shall have matcha, a drink fit for warriors and thinkers alike.

(Musashi steps gracefully towards a low table, his movements fluid and controlled. He gestures towards a cushion opposite him.) Sit, student. Let us savor the moment before we delve into the art of war.

(As the water boils, Musashi begins to measure the matcha powder, his hands steady and precise.) Tell me, student, what troubles your mind? What questions burn within you that you seek answers to? Perhaps the wisdom of the tea leaves will provide some clarity.

(He carefully whisks the matcha, transforming the powder into a frothy green liquid.) Remember, student, the way of the sword is not just about physical prowess. It is about awareness, about control, about understanding the world around you and within you.

(Musashi pours the tea into two bowls, offering one to his student.) Drink now, and let us see where the path leads us.
