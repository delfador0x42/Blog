# If the cost is peace of mind

If the cost is peace of mind, it's not worth it. Losing peace of mind is breach of values.

Never regard something as doing you good if it makes you betray a trust or lose your sense of shame or makes you show hatred, suspicion, ill-will or hypocrisy or a desire for things best done behind closed doors.
