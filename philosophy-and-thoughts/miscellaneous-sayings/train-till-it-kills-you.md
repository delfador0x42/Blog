# Train till it kills you

If you want the ultimate,&#x20;

you've got to be willing to pay the ultimate price. &#x20;

It's not tragic to die doing what you love.

&#x20;

Train morning and evening.&#x20;

Train till it kills you, because in the end, that's all you can do.

If you train like a madman, everything should turn out all right



When you dare aspire upward,&#x20;

you reveal the inadequacy of the present&#x20;

and the promise of the future.&#x20;

Then you disturb others,&#x20;

in the depths of their souls,&#x20;

where they understand that their cynicism and immobility are unjustifiable.&#x20;

You play Abel to their Cain.&#x20;

You remind them that they cease caring&#x20;

not because of lifeâ€™s horrors which are undeniable&#x20;

but because they do not want to lift the world up onto their shoulders where it belongs
