# Become Impenetrable

My main goal is to become impenetrable.

\


This means that I want to have layers upon layers in my business.

\


I pay attention to how many income streams I have and how strong they are.

\


That's why I'm now pushing BIG chunks of money into real estate.

\


Last week, I flipped a quarter of a million dollars into a mobile home park deal.

\


In business, you have to plant seeds,

\


because time matters more than money.

\


If I put money into a deal at 37 years old, it will bear fruit until I'm in my 50s.

\


That's why events like blowing a grand at dinner in Miami no longer faze me.

\


Because I know all of those properties I invested in will pay me back.

\


In my head, every property is one more layer I add to my business.

\


Before you know it...

\


All of those layers turn into a fortress.\
\


You've got this man...
