# Successful People

Some of the most successful people in the world are employees.

\


Entrepreneurship got super glamorized about 10 years ago.

\


However, if you become valuable to somebody…

\


You will make more money than a LARGE percentage of entrepreneurs.

\


This can be a hard realization for some people.

\


And I'm not saying that you shouldn't become an entrepreneur.

\


Most people don't realize it's okay to play a supporting role somewhere and still make a lot of money.

\


In my company, I have people who probably would want to avoid owning my businesses.

\


But they are very good at managing stress within the business.

\


Because at the end of the day, it is my responsibility to ensure the company performs.

\


Therefore, they can use their extra abilities to push harder for me...

\


And they are compensated very well if they perform.

\


In many ways, they have their own business within my business.

\


My ultimate goal is to find a way for them to take ownership of the business, and there's no limit to the money they can make.

\


It would demotivate both myself and my people if they were not winning.

\


Because if my people aren't winning...

\


I'm not winning.

\


Everyone eats..

\


That’s the game.

\


You've got this man...
