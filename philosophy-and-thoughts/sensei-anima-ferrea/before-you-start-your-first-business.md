# Before You Start Your First Business

A lot of times in business, what happens is what E-Myth would call an "entrepreneurial seizure."

That's when a technician says,

"I'm making this guy all this money doing these jobs. I'm going to start my own business."

He then builds building after building with a small crew of men.

They do an excellent job at first and profit from it.

Next thing you know, he puts up two buildings at once and then three.

Before you know it, he doesn't have enough men to support multiple projects.

Then, in the third building he put up, the roof starts leaking because he couldn't be there to put that roof on correctly.

It starts to snowball FAST.

Next thing you know, he's struggling with cash flow.

Often, technicians will try to start their own thing and go bankrupt.

Because they hired themselves for two roles, they are not qualified to do:

The entrepreneur and the manager.

They don't know that there need to be systems, and they need to know where they should be in the big picture of the business.

They will not accept being the head technician, hiring someone above them, and sitting on the board.

So if you are currently working for somebody else and they have a company structure.

Study what they are doing daily systems-wise and see what you can implement when you start your own thing.

It will save you a ton of headaches.

You've got this man...
