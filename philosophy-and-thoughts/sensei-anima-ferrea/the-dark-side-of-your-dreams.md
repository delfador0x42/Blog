# The Dark Side Of Your Dreams

The day I paid my dad's house off was one of the best days of my life.\


The ugly side is that the dream was more enjoyable than the reality.



Let me explain.



You work your whole life to get to a goal…



And when you reach it, you are no longer surprised you got there.\


So the rush of the dream loses its power.\


Here's an example.\


Work countless hours to achieve financial freedom, like becoming a millionaire.\


But often, you're working and grinding so hard that by the time seven figures hits your bank account…



You're not surprised that you did it.\


The work has been done, and it's just another day at the office.



This is why I emphasize the happiness of being on the climb and finding taller mountains.\


The other day was one of the best days of my life.



But I enjoyed many days of growth on the way up to this achievement.



See you at the top.



You've got this man...
