# We're Not Friends

I don't have any friends who haven't leveled up the same way I have.

\


I enjoy being around people who are at a similar stage as me.

\


The average person thinks you must get drunk and hang out with guys who want to play fantasy football.

\


However, a true friend wants to discuss business and make money together.

\


Because what they genuinely want is for you to be a hero to your wife, family, and kids.

\


When I fly back to Louisiana...

\


I have a bunch of old football and baseball teammates who live in my neighborhood.

\


All of them are absolute winners.

\


For example, I've been sending investment money to one of my old high school friends since I was 24.

\


So when he comes over, we talk about T-bills.

\


Another friend who comes over to my house does surveys on real estate deals with me.

\


So we discuss construction or land development.

\


I avoid friends who won't help me grow.

\


Because if you're not growing, you're dying.

\


Your gut will know if you're dying inside.

\


And much of that could be caused by the people you spend the most time with.\
\


You’ve got this man…
