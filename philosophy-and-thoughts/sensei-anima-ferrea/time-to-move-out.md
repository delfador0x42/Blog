# Time To Move Out

Anything past 18 or 19 years old, you have to go on your own journey.

\


Your parents had a lifetime to get their shit together.

\


Now it's your responsibility.

\


Not only for yourself...

\


But for your future wife and children.

\


You will need to have your shit together to support them.

\


Trying to fix somebody else in your current state isn't helpful.

\


Granted, I love taking care of my family...

\


Paying off my dad's house was one of the best feelings in the world.

\


But I had to build myself up as a man before I could do that.

\


There's a saying:

\


"Put your breathing mask on first in the airplane."

\


If you can't breathe, you can't help anyone else put on a mask.

\


So if you're an adult, it's time to become a man.

\


That's the only way you're going to put yourself in a position to really help anyone you love.

\


Go become that man.

\


It's time to go on your own mission.\
\


You've got this man...
