# You Can't Fix A Broken Bird

You can't fix a broken person.

One of the mistakes I made in my 20s was attempting to fix people.

I came to realize that you won't be able to change anyone.

The best thing you can do is help those who are already winners become even bigger winners.

I've tried throwing money and time at it, thinking,

"This person would be amazing if they weren't dealing with substance abuse issues or consistently showing up late for work."

There have been numerous instances when I wholeheartedly tried to change people.

However, I've never succeeded in doing so.

Instead of shaping individuals from clay…

Focus on molding those who are already solid, like granite.

Trying to transform clay into granite will always fail.

Because you're working with the wrong material.

Avoid the mistake of constantly trying to uplift others.

You'll never be able to fix a broken bird.

You’ve got this man…
