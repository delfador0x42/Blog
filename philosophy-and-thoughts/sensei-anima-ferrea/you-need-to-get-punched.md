# You Need To Get Punched

My favorite word is relentless.\
\
I often see guys with outstanding talent start, then quit, then start multiple times in  businesses.\
\
Why? \
\
Because they took a few beginners licks.. \
\
I will see them enter the business and take these  hits and start pulling away…\
\
But taking these licks are where the growth is, where the money making lessons are. \
\
The problem with this is…\
\
He's about to take those exact beginners licks in the next industry he enters. \
\
There was a point in my career where I said,\
\
"No matter what happens, I will stay in the same business."\
\
It didn't matter if I went bankrupt. \
\
I wouldn't have to rebuild my business, my contacts, relearn the trade, understand tools and equipment, and relearn insurance and Workman's Comp.\
\
I could have chosen a better business model instead of hanging steel.\
\
What I did get right that many of my peers did NOT.. \
\
I didn't quit to start something else.\
\
I continued taking the ass whooping. \
\
With a relentless mindset, you will save YEARS of unnecessary pain and frustration.\
\
Don't give up. \
\
Keep fighting.\

You've got this man...
