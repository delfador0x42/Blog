# Bad Days Don’t Exist

I can’t have a bad day.

I say that about three times a day.

Because it comes up in small talk.

By saying that, I’m putting it out into reality.

And I’m giving a gift to whoever heard me say it.

It’s spreading something positive.

When I continuously lost my Instagram account…

I didn’t have a bad day.

My day was absolutely amazing without it.

All it did was make one of my other platforms stronger...

If you can choose to build the muscle that frames your scenarios like that, then you’ll never lose.

You’ll be able to say,

“Ok, now my YouTube is about to get strong as fuck.”

Or

“My Twitter is about to go to a different place.”

It doesn’t matter.

You have to choose to make every day a good day.

Once you do that, you start learning how to create muscles to flip the script with everything that can happen to you…

There is only one thing left to do.

WIN…

You've got this man...
