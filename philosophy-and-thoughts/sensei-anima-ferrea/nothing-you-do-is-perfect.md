# Nothing You Do Is Perfect

Your mind is never going to be right.

Just START.

I always talk about being imperfect on purpose and firing the gun.

You can wait until your mind is right…

It's never right.

You will think it's right until you get ROCKED.

Go in there and take that lick.

There's no reason to put off starting EVER.

To this day, I don't know how my YouTube channel will go…

But I know that I will support guys making money in the Real World and The War Room.

Ultimately, my channel might be just helping as many guys as possible by answering questions, and that's it.

I would not have started this channel if I waited for my mind to get right.

I would have never been able to help and change thousands of people's lives.

Fire, Ready, Aim.

You've got this man...
