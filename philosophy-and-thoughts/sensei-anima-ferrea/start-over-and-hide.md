# Start Over & Hide?

I get questions asking what you should do when you're at a low, want to start over, and hide from everyone...

Instead of hiding, spending time alone is a great place to start.

Some of my most significant periods of growth happened when I faced challenging situations head-on...

And I would isolate myself while not running away from the problems that needed to be solved.

Often, when you're going through something and experiencing a low point...

Finding a quiet place where you can hear the voices in your head speak to you is the best way to take action.

There were times when I went to job sites out of state and stayed in small hotels, so there were no distractions.

This wasn't Miami or Louisiana, where there were girls around.

It was just me and a hotel room, sitting still with my thoughts at the end of the day.

Nobody could speak to me except myself.

You must lead your life by controlling the influence of your mind and bending yourself to your will.

To do this, you must first be able to hear your thoughts.

Take this time alone to listen to yourself think.

You will be shocked by how you receive the answers.

You’ve got this man…
