# Everything Should Hurt

Physical pain is something that is very important for any young man to experience.

It allows you to trust yourself, and it enables you to place yourself in a controlled setting during stressful situations.

That is why you need to work out.

Because as things get stressful at work…

You have already gone through physical things that are substantially more stressful than the mental things that are going through your mind.

If you have a bad day, lose a little bit of money, or have a bad situation at work…

It’s not going to hurt you physically.

It’s only going to hurt you mentally.

And just like money, improving your fitness will never end.

The goal line will keep moving as you level up your physique.

As you level up, you will always want to look better and feel stronger.

Get your fitness right.

It will substantially improve every area of your life.

You've got this man...
