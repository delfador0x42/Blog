# BEWARE OF VANITY METRICS

What does it mean?

\


Shit you measure, that doesn't matter.

\


I know people that use titles and statistics to glorify themselves.

\


This is bullshit.

\


Saying you're a CEO of a startup company that makes no money is foolish to feel good about.

\


Furthermore, owning a company that generates millions of dollars without profit is even more foolish because they're taking substantial risks with no reward.

\


I could buy a hundred apartment buildings and tell everyone about them.

\


But if those apartment buildings weren't profitable, I would be a bragging fool.

\


Remember, titles, follower counts, revenue, and potential don't matter.

\


RESULTS DO.

\


Measure wisely.\


You've got this man...
