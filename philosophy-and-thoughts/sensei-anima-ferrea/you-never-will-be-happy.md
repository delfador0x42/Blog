# You Never Will Be Happy

You're never going to be happy when arriving at the destination.



It's always the path to the destination that will make you happy.\


Happiness is always going to be growth.



It's never going to be a stagnant destination.



If you feel like you're progressing, you should be happy.\


If you no longer feel like you're progressing...



And you're no longer looking forward and are sedentary in your position...\


Then you'll feel miserable because the best part of human existence is growing and expanding.\


It's how we are.\


You've got this man...
