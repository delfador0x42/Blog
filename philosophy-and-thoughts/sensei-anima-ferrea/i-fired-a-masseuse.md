# I FIRED A Masseuse

Yesterday, I ordered two masseuses to the house for my team.

\


I asked the masseuses to be women because I had flown over many of my female employees to Florida for a team-building event this week.

\


I wanted to give them massages as part of the event.

\


Then we ran into an issue.

\


Instead of two women, they sent a woman and her son, probably because she was trying to save costs.

\


I told them,

\


"Listen, I don't have a problem that your son is a masseuse."

\


"The problem for me is, I flew my people in, and I don't think their husbands would appreciate me getting a male massage for their wife."

\


For that reason, I told them to send another woman and the man home.

\


I paid the man, but the point is this.

\


It's your job to honor the trust another man gives you when you employ his wife.

\


I would never sabotage that trust by playing games with masseuses or anything.

\


Remember this...

\


When you employ a husband, you have a duty to his wife.

\


When you hire a wife, you have a duty to her husband.

\


Build a team like a family.

\


It will become an empire...\
\


You've got this man...
