# Money Habit Keeping You Poor

The more money I makeâ€¦



The more I look at money as a tool.\


I blow money and am disrespectful to it sometimes.



But Iâ€™m also very respectful of it.\


Letâ€™s say something is more expensive but FASTER.\


Iâ€™ll spend the extra $2-3 grand to get a shit load of things DONE.



Because firing the gun FAST matters more to me.



The more you think about getting something done, the higher it will cost you.\


When you have extra incomeâ€¦



You can afford to miss a couple of bullets.\


Because you already have a tank full of extra bullets ready to fire.\


And miss from time to time.\


You can wait six months.



But it will cost you a big opportunity.\


Shoot the gun ðŸ‘‰ \


You've got this man...
