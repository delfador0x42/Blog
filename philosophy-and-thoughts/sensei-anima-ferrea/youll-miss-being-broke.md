# Youâ€™ll Miss Being Broke

There are times when I missed being broke.

\


I'll tell you why...

\


I didn't have a safety net.

\


You'll never feel more alive than when you don't have a safety net beneath you.

\


When you're building your story...

\


When you're sleeping on an air mattress...

\


When you have unicorn blood...

\


Eating off a paper plate with your back against the wall.

\


And it's just YOU.

\


It's freedom mixed with fear, possibility, hope, and passion.

\


All your focus should be on the man you will become.\
\


You've got this man...
