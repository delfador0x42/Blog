# Championships

We're not all athletes.

\


We're not all born super athletic.

\


However, I know everyone is capable of learning if they put in the effort.

\


Effort that will force you to consistently learn every day.

\


And it doesn't have to be sports.

\


It can be any skill.

\


They just need to be shown where to start.

\


All you need to do as a young individual is ask the right questions.

\


Questions that force you to LEARN instead of memorizing, as a college student would in a classroom.

\


Even if there is pain involved.

\


I want everyone who watches my content to succeed...

\


I want to see you at the winner's table with championships.

\


But if you truly want to learnâ€¦

\


You must be willing to take a few hard hits to learn life-changing lessons.

\


Eventually, you will learn to slip the toughest blows.
