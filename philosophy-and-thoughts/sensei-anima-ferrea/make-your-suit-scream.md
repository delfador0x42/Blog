# Make Your Suit SCREAM

In my 20s, I remember buying $100 suits from Burlington coat factory.\


If you can get the color and fit right…\


You can build a wardrobe for less than $1500.\


It's not the suit that makes the man.\


Remember…\


It's the MAN that makes the suit SCREAM.\


The better shape you are in, the better your clothes fit you...\


That's why fitness is important.\


You can walk into a room with someone.



I get asked.



"Why are you so dressed up?"



Often, I get to say the following with a slight smirk.



"We're wearing the same outfit."\


Three things matter about your clothes:\


-It's about how it fits you.\


-How you walk in with it.\


-And the confidence you have in your body.



It's a lot easier to look good in clothes…   \


When you look like the mannequin.\


You've got this man...
