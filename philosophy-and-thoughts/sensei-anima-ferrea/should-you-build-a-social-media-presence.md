# Should You Build A Social Media Presence?

There are three businesses I run every day:

Construction, real estate, and my online business.

People often ask me if having a social media presence is necessary, and my answer is yes.

Everything we do online feeds the other two businesses beautifully because it attracts talent, investors, and team members.

If you look at a company, its core values should reflect the owner's values;

Otherwise, you'll hire people who don't align with you.

I greatly emphasize intention, which is our number one core value.

I bring people into my businesses who already align with me, and it's easy to do.

People who watch my content are already vetted because they know my opinion.

I don't even have to have a conversation with them anymore.

The same goes for anyone who wants to work for me.

They already know I prioritize truth, conservatism, and loving people.

If you own a business and want to start branding yourself online, I highly recommend it.

It will attract people who genuinely care about you and your growing empire.

You've got this man...
