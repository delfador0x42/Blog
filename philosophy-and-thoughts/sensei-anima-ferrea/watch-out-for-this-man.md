# Watch Out For This Man

It's not a bad man I watch out for...

It's a desperate man.

\


You will soon realize that most bad people are too lazy to harm you.

\


They shouldn't be your concern.

\


It's the desperate man who is the true liability.

\


It's either his head on the line or yours.

\


Who do you think he'll choose?

\


That's why I never get too close to men who aren't abundant in money and women.

\


They can be the type of guys who will text your ex or empty your business savings account.

\


Keep an eye out for these men.

\


And most importantly...

\


Make sure you don't become a desperate man yourself.

\
You've got this man...
