# Notch Count Doesn't Matter

I never want you guys to think that the number of women you sleep with is tied to your value as a man.

\


That couldn't be a more unhealthy way to look at yourself.

\


I know some guys out there like to brag about their notch count…

\


But that comes from a place of insecurity.

\


If you're a virgin, you're no less of a good or valuable person than someone who has slept with 100 women.

\


If you want to sleep with women but haven't slept with many…

\


Then focus on what you still need to do to become the kind of man women would want.

\


Strive to be a better man.

\


Women will naturally be drawn to you.

\


The most important thing to understand is that you want to have choice in life.

\


Although my sexual preference is to sleep with women, that's my choice.

\


Your choice may be different from mine.

\


For example, if you want to have a long-term girlfriend or get married and have many kids…

\


Then go for it.

\


And you should never second-guess what you want in your life.

\


You've got this man...
