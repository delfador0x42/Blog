# What You SHOULD Be Doing

If every man were to look in the mirror and say,\


"What should I be doing?"\


In his gut, he would know what he's supposed to be doing.\


However, most of the time, he will not go to the mirror and act on it.



He doesn't ask himself what competencies he lacks or what he's afraid of.\


If you can identify the missing competencies, the fear will go away.\


Let's consider a scenario where you want to buy some real estate.\


You're about to make a lot of money, and if you don't invest in real estate, you will buy Lambos instead.



The reality is Lambos will not generate income until you're 100 years old.



So why aren't you buying apartment buildings?



You might not understand net operating income, property management, property acquisition, and debt service.\


But if you studied real estate and gained a comprehensive understanding of itâ€¦



When that deal came in, you wouldn't have any fear because you would know how to buy and own real estate.\


Then, BOOM, you would've taken immediate action.\

You've got this man...
