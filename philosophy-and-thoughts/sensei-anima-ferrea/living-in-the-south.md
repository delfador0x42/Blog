# Living In The South

There's nothing you can't do when living in a small town.

\


If you went from $0 to $250,000 a year, your life would not differ greatly from mine.

\


I might make millions of dollars a year but in terms of happiness...

\


There's not much difference between my happiness and yours.

\


We can probably buy the same things we want.

\


Whatever town you're from in Mississippi...

\


It isn't much bigger than my hometown in Denham Springs, Louisiana.

\


I've lived in trailer parks and had a beat-up pickup truck that wouldn't start, making it difficult to get to work.

\


I'm telling you right now, you can change your entire life just by living in that small town.

\


Even if you don't leave Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, or any small town in America, you can become THE MAN.

\


There's not a thing in this world that you can't accomplish.

\


All you have to do is work your ass off, listen, talk less, find guys who know what they're doing, respect them, and learn the ropes.

\


If you do that, you can go to the MOON from any part of America.

\


Don't ever forget that.

\
You've got this man...
