# Embrace The Loneliness

Lost a friend or got your heart broken?

GOOD, you needed it.

I promise you it was a bandaid that needed to get ripped off.

It's an excellent opportunity for you to grow.

I hope there was pain, loneliness, and darkness involved in it.

To clarify, I don't hope for bad things for you.

I want you to experience being alone, having your back against the wall, and having no net.

Once you go through it and succeed…

You'll quickly be able to see how much you can trust yourself.

And when you trust yourself…

Your ability to push, take risks, and lead people through hard times levels up 10X.

If you're going through this now, know it's a GIFT.

I hope you get the most out of it because you're the king of your own life.

It will be the best story you will tell once you become the man you always wanted to be.

You've got this man...
