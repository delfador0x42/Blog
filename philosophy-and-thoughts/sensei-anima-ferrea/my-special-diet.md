# My Special Diet

I'm always in the middle of learning something new.

\


A new skill, a new piece of information, a new concept.

\


I'm well aware that I will never know everything.

\


And I don't plan to.

\


Because there are more things that I say NO to learning than I will ever say YES to.

\


And the tricky part is finding the thing that I want to learn.

\


I call this an information diet.

\


I only allow myself to learn things that will directly benefit my life.

\


Everything else is pushed to the side.

\


Stop overindulging in information and skills that will never help you.

\
You've got this man...
