# The List Of Hate

One thing I do to ground myself daily is through something called:

\


"The List of Hate."

\


It's a group text where I have a guy go through my comments and screenshot anything negative that gets said to me...

\


Which he then sends to me and my YouTube manager.

\


I use this list to keep myself in reality.

\


So I can check myself to see if there is any truth and calibrate if there is.

\


Because if 1 in 100 comments says, "You're an asshole...."

\


I want to know why by digging into what they said and see if there is any truth.

\


More often than not, there isn't.

\


But if there is one that I agree with, I can strive to improve as a person.

\


By bettering myself, I can influence a young fan to grow based on what I say.

\


It's a business system that doesn't generate money.

\


But it's one of the healthiest systems we have.\
\


You’ve got this man…
