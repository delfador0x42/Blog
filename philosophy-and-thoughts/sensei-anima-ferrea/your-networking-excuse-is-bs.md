# Your Networking Excuse Is BS

One of the best networking spots is the gym.

\


People who frequently visit tend to have money.

\


If you're already in good shape, it will be easier for you to meet influential individuals.

\


The best approach is to start by asking questions or giving compliments.

\


If a guy is in the middle of a set, it's best not to interrupt him.

\


Only approach him when he's taking a break, about to leave the gym, or changing weights.

\


When you engage in conversation, you can begin by saying,

\


"Hey man, sorry to interrupt, but it bothers me to be this close and not speak. My name is Justin."

\


Afterward, allow them to continue their workout, and you may reencounter them.

\


The next time you see him, initiate the conversation with,

\


"Hey John, how have you been? How's work going?"

\


Avoid trying to extract everything from him and keep the conversation brief, allowing him to resume his workout.

\


Remember, networking and building relationships naturally develop over several months.

\


Once you establish a good rapport, hanging out outside the gym will feel more natural...

\


Leading to even more connections and ultimately helping you make more money.\

You’ve got this man…
