# You HATE Your 9-5

If you're working a 9-5 and not satisfied…\
\
It's because you put your whole energy into something with a cap.\
\
The best businesses you can work for are the ones where, as the company grows…\
\
The more money you make.\
\
There's nothing wrong with being employed. \
\
The problem comes when you feel like you have a ceiling.\
\
You need to make sure you're putting your life into something that has massive growth potential and satisfies you.\
\
It will give you the feeling of working towards the life you want.\
\
And knowing that you can do as much as you want to without a limit.\
\
That's what any ambitious young man REALLY wants.\
\


You've got this man...
