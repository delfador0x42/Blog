# You’re Too Comfortable

When you're born into a rich family.

\


In the back of your head...

\


You know you earned none of that and grew up in a comfortable home.

\


It's scary because you must WORK your ass off to reach your dad's position.

\


If I had grown up in a house where my dad made a lot of money…

\


I would approach him and say,

\


"Man, thank you so much; how can I work with you?"

\


I will expect my boys to say this because I don't want to ruin my kids.

\


If you have a dad who's doing well, all you can do is think,

\


"I have this skillset and was born in this generation."

\


"I can bring his greatness to the world and bring legacy to his name."

\


And if you commit to the process, you will eventually have a kid and have them do the same thing.

\


That's why I never expect my children to ever work for a company; they will work for the family.

\


People are going to know our last name in our town, for damn sure.

\


The last thing you want is to be in a position where the first kid makes it, the second grows it, and the third blows it.

\


One of the most beautiful things you can have in your future is to walk into your dining room...

\


And see all of the G's with your last name in framed portraits.

\
You’ve got this man…
