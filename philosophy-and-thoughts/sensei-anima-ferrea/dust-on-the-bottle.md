# Dust On The Bottle

There's an old country song that says:

\


"There might be a little dust on the bottle, but don't let it fool you about what's inside."

\


This is a great life lesson.

\


People often look at things through a lens of what the world would have them believe is valuable.

\


It couldn't be more foolish to let the world put a value on the things in your life when you have two eyes and a heart to look for yourself.

\


For example, telling a girl I own a steel construction business doesn't sound very cool.

\


From the outset, most people would not own this kind of business.

\


But I can tell you from experience things are not always what they seem.

\


However, I've certainly seen the benefits of brick-and-mortar business.

\


In regards to womenâ€¦

\


Most "10 out of 10s" you see on Instagram are often no more than masterful makeup artists wearing push-up bras.

\


That "cute girl" you think is a 7 at the grocery store often looks like a Victoria's Secret model without that uniform.

\


And comes with a better heart.

\


The lesson here is to always look and assign value to yourself.

\


You never know who or what has been overlooked at face value and what diamonds might be found in the rough.

\


You've got this man...
