# Why I Flex

Flexing is important.\


Let me explain why.



It's because the younger generation watches those videos...\


And the reality is that they will only pay attention if you demonstrate your success.\


If I don't showcase my lifestyle, I will let down anyone who wants to change their life.\


The last thing I want is for a kid to sign up with dishonest people who sell false dreams and leave their fans empty-handed.\


Take Shooter, for example.\


He dedicated his entire career to special ops and big corporations...\


All while gaining international experience, understanding geopolitics, and growing his wealth.\


When he flexes, there's substance behind it because he has years of experience to back himself up.\


On the other hand, when inexperienced NFT experts flex...



It's just a bubble that could burst at any time.\


Try to burst someone like Shooter.\


Good luck.\

You've got this man...
