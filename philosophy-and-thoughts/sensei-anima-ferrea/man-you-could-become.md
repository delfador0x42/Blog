# Man You Could Become

I like to daydream about the man I am going to become.

\


The best feeling ever is when you know that in 5 years...

\


You can live the life you've always wished for.

\


A life that lets you work anytime and anywhere you go.

\


I remember a day in Louisiana when all I thought about was when I could go beyond my hometown.

\


And afford to live in a city like Dubai or Miami.

\


All those things ultimately happened.

\


And I hope anyone reading this can do it too.

\


It's going to take a lot of effort.

\


You'll face tough times along the way.

\


But nothing in life comes easy.

\


However, it's much easier to feel excitement when you see people like you getting closer to their dreams.

\


People you can talk to when work gets challenging.

\


Because, ultimately, life is easier when you're hunting in a pack.

\


A pack that shares one common goal.

\


Becoming men that 90% of society would find hard to become.\

You've got this man...
