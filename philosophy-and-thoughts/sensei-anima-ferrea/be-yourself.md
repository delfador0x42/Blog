# Be Yourself

The further away I get from home...

\


The prouder I am of where I’m from.

\


No matter how big you get in life, how much money you make, and how far you go...

\


Don’t leave that part of you from your hometown in your suitcase.

\


Bring it with you.

\


That’s the part that will make people appreciate who you are and accept you.

\


It’s who you are that people will love.

\


It’s those small things, like being from a different country or a fly-over state.

\


Because that’s the most genuine part of you.

\


Don’t make the mistake of changing it.

\


You've got this man...
