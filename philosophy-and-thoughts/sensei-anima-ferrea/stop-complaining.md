# Stop Complaining

Complaining about your problems won't fix them.

\


It's a waste of time and energy.

\


No one wants to follow people that complain.

\


They will think that you're not in control of the situation.

\


Your competition's eyes light up when they know you were preparing to quit.

\


Because by doing so, you start to talk yourself out of what you are doing.

\


Truth is, nothing worth having will come to you quickly.

\


You WILL feel horrible...

\


You WILL make mistakes...

\


You WILL fail.

\


The key is to make this pain look EASY.

\


This makes you a man people want to follow.

\


This makes you a man your enemies are intimidated by.

\


Because if you continue slamming against the wall long and hard enoughâ€¦

\


You WILL eventually break through.

\


So make everything look easy.

\


Don't complain.\
\


You've got this man...
