# Superheroes Are Dead

The reason why guys like Anima Invicta and I get a following is that they've taken characters similar to us away.

\


I was sitting at Anima Invicta's house recently in Romania, and I had a photo sent to me from a young man showing two posters...

\


One of me and one of Anima Invicta side-by-side.

\


I showed Anima Invicta and told him,

\


"You know what? That used to be Rambo."

\


In many ways, they have taken superheroes away from young men.

\


Most original superheroes are "toxically masculine," if you think about it.

\


The truth is young men today need to be masculine.

\


They also need to be capable of danger and violence if they have to be.

\


There's nothing wrong with being masculine as long as they can love and protect the people they should care for.

\


In most of those movies from the 80s and 90s, he was a good guy protecting, providing, and caring for the people he loved.

\


Young men need to see those movies, and I'd love to see real action heroes return to the movies.

\


New scripts, new superheroes.\

You've got this man...
