# You’re The Captain

If you're the ship's captain and acting as if it will sink...

\


People WILL jump off your ship.

\


They are trying to survive.

\


If you are in a leadership position and people see you as the North Star...

\


It shouldn’t matter how you feel on a bad day.

\


And it certainly doesn't serve you well to project it outwardly.

\


By projecting it, you are telling everyone,

\


"LEAVE ME."

\


As a leader, you should expect and allow people in your organization, family, or relationship to be “normal.”

\


Because if you embrace that responsibility...

\


Your mindset becomes,

\


"These people I care about are normal. I'm the superhero."

\


Don’t show fear to your people.

\


You’re the captain of the ship.\
\
You've got this man...
