# Saturated Businesses

The term “too saturated” is bullshit.

If you have energy…

You can outwork EVERYONE that is your competitor.

Most people, including some business owners, need to try harder.

Most average businesses do about $40,000 in revenue.

That’s nothing.

Whatever space you are in right now…

I can tell you that 90/100 of those people that are creating the saturation are lazy.

Go outwork them.

It’s that simple.

You've got this man...
