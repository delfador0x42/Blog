# It's Easy To Spot Con Artists

It is very easy to spot if someone is legit in business and to spot who is a con artist.

Most people think money is evil, and people with money are "bad."

They also think successful businessmen hurt others to acquire that money.

That's NOT true.

A con artist can rarely deceive so many people and maintain a position of abundance.

Individuals who have money understand abundance.

They treat people right over many years.

They are competent in their craft.

They engage in repeat business with others who don't get sued and go bankrupt.

I trust a man who is successful far more than someone who is just getting by.

I will always look at how much success that person has acquired within their industry.

Once I see it, there is likely strong ethics within them.

That's when I know they are capable of being competent and following through on their promises.

You've got this man...
