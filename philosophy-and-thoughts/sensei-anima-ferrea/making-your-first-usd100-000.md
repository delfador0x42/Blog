# Making Your First $100,000

People often ask me,

\


"What should I do to get my first $100,000?"

\


I tell them, "Friend, that is the wrong question."

\


The right question is,

\


"How can I build a monthly system that will spit out $100,000?"

\


When I was a young man, I always thought,

\


"Man... If I could save $10,000, I could do x, y, z."

\


When, in reality, it should have been,

\


"If I could put a system in place that I can follow daily, I'll be making $10,000, $20,000, or even $30,000 a month."

\


Alabama's head football coach, Nick Saban, would call this "The Process."

\


There's a reason why Nick Saban wins championships year after year with new players and coaches.

\


All because he works on that process so much and tinkers with the gears of his business...

\


To the point where it spits out winning results every time.

\


So if you're a young man reading this, trying to make money...

\


You need to get to 30,000 feet and look at your business.

\


And look at all the parts that make the system work, which will end up helping you produce the results you want.

\


Because money is just the result of what was previously done.

\


Managing the gears and systems of the business will make you money.

\


Then everything else is accounting.
