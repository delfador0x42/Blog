# Find This QUICKLY

You don't know what you don't know.

\


The most dangerous parts of growing my business were the things I didn't know.

\


That's why I always tried to find mentors quickly.

\


I used to go to people who had done it bigger and better than me on all levels and say,

\


"Hey, I'm looking at doing this. What do you do about this?"

\


They helped me set up systems in the business that prevented me from encountering problems they had to pay for.

\


For example, in my industry, sometimes buildings fall down.

\


At the time, I was doing buildings so small that it wasn't on my radar that a building would fall because they weren't big enough.

\


However, I found mentors, and they would tell me,

\


"Anima Ferrea, you need to create a temporary bracing plan for the building."

\


After those conversations, I started bracing my buildings properly.

\


And for that reason, I've not had a building fall.

\


It's important to always be learning as you're growing.

\


Because if you don't, you might be the person to pay for a mistake.

\


And many times, it's not necessary because some other person

somewhere would have taught you..

\


And they have already paid for it.

\


You've got this man...
