# Stop Overcomplicating Business

All Business Is The Same

\


Business is often more of a formula than anything else.

\


If you have a formula, take out the x and put in y…

\


This applies to real estate, sales, construction, drop shipping, e-commerce, copywriting…

\


It doesn't matter what model of Business it is.

\


Most businesses you see are required to deal with:

\


People, Management, Marketing, Leadership, KPIs, Team motivation.

\


The rest of the business is the same outside a specific product.

\


Remember this if you're beginning to learn how to make money.

\


Focus on mastering the fundamentals of Business, and your success will follow.

\


You've got this man...
