# #1 Thing I Look For When Hiring

My first core value in any business that I have is intention.

It’s the #1 thing I care about when deciding whether or not to keep or bring on any employee.

Intention is free.

People that have intention have these qualities:

-They pay attention\
-They are always alert\
-They are always ready\
-They think for themselves

And most importantly…

THEY THINK PROFITABLY.

Do you want to have a job?

Make them money.

Do you want to make a friend in business?

Make them money.

If you see something that can make something more profitable that fills the pockets of the people you work for…

You’d be shocked by how much they want to keep you around.

It shows them that you CARE about them and the business.

You've got this man...
