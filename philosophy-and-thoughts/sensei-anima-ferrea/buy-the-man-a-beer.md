# Buy The Man A Beer

Guys, I want us to do something special.

\


As you know, I have a heart for the men that build this country.

\


I want to create a movement in which we come together independently…

\


To do what I would like to call “Buy The Man A Beer.”

\


It’s not just about buying the guy a beer.

\


It’s about seeing a guy in work boots that are working hard…

\


That you could buy a lunch for, get a drink, or show genuine appreciation.

\


Let’s make this movement grow by tagging @justinwinwaller7 on Instagram whenever you guys do something nice for a man who helps this country run.

\


It can be a construction worker, truck driver, police officer…

\


Or any common man doing a common job without which the world could not live.

\


Let’s get these guys the appreciation they deserve.

\


Buy the man a beer.

\
You've got this man...
