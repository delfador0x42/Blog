# Separating Family & Business Is BS

I think that separating business and family is bullshit.

\


The same thing applies to separating personal life and work.

\


How can people get behind you if they don’t know that you care about them as a person?

\


How can a team get behind you and want to create a family if the bag in some way can’t be for everyone?

\


Everybody that works directly with me on my management team will have a key to my house in Dubai if they ever want to go.

\


Many bosses don’t invite their employees to their house because they don’t want them to see how big their home is.

\


Fuck that.

\


I’m currently trying to get two of my main people to buy lots in my neighborhood.

\


I’ll even break away some of my money to help them move near me.

\


The closer you are as a unit as a family, the better.

\


If I can walk out my front door and take 35 steps to be at my partner or operations manager’s house…

\


That means we can talk business all the time.\
\


You’ve got this man…
