# Before You Decide To Quit

Every time something gets hard in one of my businesses…



I think, “My competition is suffering right now.”



“And they’re probably going to quit.”



When I started hanging it steel, it was ROUGH.\


I didn’t find a cheat code until after a decade of getting punched in the face.\


Now it’s a money machine.\


But it wasn’t always this way.\


Regardless of what you do, crypto pumps will not always be around.\


Your business is going to be hard.\


The harder it is, the more you should be excited to do it.\


That’s where the opportunity is.\


It will often take A LOT of pain and pressure to make diamonds.\


It’s difficult to understand things like the business, employees, insurance, workers comp, and general liability.\


When I look at obstacles, I think of how much money it will make me.



You have to reframe your relationship with these obstacles.



Make them opportunities that are going to make you stand out later.\


Eventually, you will become proud of what you’re doing…\


And get ahead of your competition that QUITS.\


You've got this man...
