# You Are The North Star

Don’t ever look at yourself as a victim.

Your hardship should be part of your unique story.

When you can walk through dark places and emerge out of it…

You begin to see yourself as the North Star of your own life.

It’s the star that guides you to the right people, the right environment, and the countless options you have always dreamed of having.

I always say the best part of your life is realizing that no one is coming to save you.

Your confidence grows and builds with time as you rely on yourself.

Once you have experienced living independently, you can trust yourself.

This process takes YEARS of making mistakes and facing the consequences.

But eventually, you learn from the consequences of your actions.

That’s when you start to trust yourself.

And when you can trust yourself, you can accomplish great things...

And be confident that you’re becoming the person you want to become.\

You've got this man...
