# A Lucky Bounce

A lot of people say that successful people are merely lucky, but I disagree.\


Do you know how Michael Jordan effortlessly makes those incredible under-the-backboard shots with a spin?\


Let's assume that 80-90% of his shots are a result of his skill, including:\


-Jumping in the air

-Spinning the ball

-Knowing where the goal is



Hypothetically, let's say that 10% of the ball actually going into the goal is attributed to luck.\


What most people fail to see is the hard work and preparation that athletes like Jordan undergo.\


They put in everything to ensure they are in the right place at the right time.\


Every single factor contributes to their ability to make the ball roll in.



And luck plays a BIG part in it.\


But know thisâ€¦



Hard work is the ONLY way you will ever get the ball to bounce your way.



BELIEVE THAT...\
