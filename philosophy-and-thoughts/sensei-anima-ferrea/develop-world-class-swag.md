# Develop World Class SWAG

Joe Burrow is one of my favorite people.

\


I saw his career progress from being buried in the depth chart at Ohio State...

\


To becoming a superstar in his senior season at LSU.

\


When he transferred to LSU as a Junior, he was mediocre.

\


But somehow, he became a superstar football player.

\


I don't know what happened to Joe, but I can tell you this...

\


Something happened in his head that changed almost everything.

\


His confidence was different from his sophomore to senior year.

\


He developed a SWAG that wasn't just on the football field but also in how he carried himself outside the game.

\


The lesson is this...

\


It only takes one spark to change how you carry yourself.

\


The best thing a young man can do is try new things to develop self-confidence.

\
\


It's the best way to change your surroundings, similar to how Joe Burrow transferred from Ohio State to LSU.

\


You get put in a competitive environment where you're free to develop 3 critical skills:

\


Money, fitness, and mindset.

\


Because the truth is...

\


Genuine SWAG exists when you're confident in everything about yourself.



You’ve got this man…
