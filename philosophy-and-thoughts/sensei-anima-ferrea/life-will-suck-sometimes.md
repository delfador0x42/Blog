# Life Will Suck Sometimes

I once lost 1 million dollars in my business.

\


I owed vendors a significant amount of money.

\


And I was in physical pain after my fourth shoulder surgery replacement.

\


On top of that, I had a hard time exercising.

\


I was simply in a bad place.

\


There was no other excuse I had except to get out of it.

\


It wasn't an easy experience for me; I should have gone bankrupt, but somehow I didn't.

\


These things happen in life.

\


I suspect that I will experience another low point in life.

\


It could be pain or disappointment on a large scale that will require me to pivot.

\


But that's just a part of life.

\


You have to do everything to prevent those things from happening.

\


And if it does happen, time will heal it, and you must fight your way out.

\


The only thing that will stay with you forever is if you quit.

\


If I had quit when I was down a million dollars...

\


It would've haunted me to this day.

\


And thank God I didn't.

\


With every punch you take, you will learn to slip it.

\


Then you'll have an unbreakable skill that lasts forever.

\


Perseverance.\
\


You've got this man...
