# Taking Down Barriers

I try to always initiate as many everyday encounters as possible when it comes to interacting with employees.

\


Grabbing them coffee, going to lunch with them, etc.

\


I do it in the field as well.

\


It's nothing for me to fly across the country just to take my guys to lunch.

\


Why?

\


It removes walls.

\


Businesses with walls, also known as businesses with politics, are SLOW and unhealthy.

\


Most new employees in your business will have their guard up.

\


Tearing down these walls can be helpful to your relationship with your people, the company's profit, and your ability to position yourself in any market.

\


Often, I find myself recalibrating my people to understand that I care about them.

\


One of the best ways to achieve this is by doing kind things for them, mixed with small talk.

\


I keep my office staff's favorite coffee orders for Starbucks and CC's on my phone.

\


I will bring it to them unannounced and talk to them about anything.

\


When a crucial conversation comes, they are far more comfortable with me than they would have been otherwise.

\


This allows us to remove barriers and get to the truth.

\


How so?

\


Because they trust me.

\


It's just a normal conversation.

\


They've had hundreds of conversations with me at this point.

\


None of those conversations made them feel pressure.

\


And that's something that I know they likely won't get anywhere else.

\


This way, when it comes to a difficult conversation at work, they can open up to me and tell me what they think.

\


And that's what I want, because if they tell me what they think...

\


I can get their honest opinion and real raw answer.

\


Then we can make real movement and real change in the business.

\


I want them personally to know my family and friends.

\


I want them to know everything about me.

\


Because I have nothing to hide.

\


Once the walls in the business are down, we have trust.

\


And when we have trust, we have SPEED.

\


Speed is money.\
\


You've got this man...
