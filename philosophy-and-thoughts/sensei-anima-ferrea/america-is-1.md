# America Is #1

I grew up as an American, and I want to remain American.

\


If you look at the scoreboard...

\


America is still in the lead.

\


However, we have let the lead slip a bit.

\


It is up to us Americans to extend our lead before we rot from within.

\


No nation is larger and more powerful than America.

\


We possess the largest military.

\


Too many people are connected to our currency.

\


Too many people invest in our bonds.

\


And too many people rely on us.

\


Yes, India's emergence as the new China, the conflicts in Russia, and China's exploitation of Africa for natural resources grab my attention.

\


I get it.

\


But we are still America.

\


If Americans remember what it was like when people took pride in displaying the flag in their front yardsâ€¦

\


Instead of raising more Ukrainian flags...

\


We would become a stronger nation.

\


I am tired of Americans who apologize for being proud to be American.

\


If you do not want to be American, then leave.

\


We are still the greatest country and must maintain it this way.

Happy 4th of July ðŸ’ªðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
