# The Biggest Time Waste

Cooking and cleaning are low value tasks for anyone looking to level up.

\


Especially when you’re broke.

\


Instead, get paper plates and buy a rotisserie chicken.

\


We have bigger and better shit to do.

“But Anima Ferrea, it’s cheaper to cook myself instead of getting a food prep service.”

\


BULLSHIT.

\


You aren’t calculating time spent at your rate of pay.

\


Don’t get me started on the fuel, miscellaneous cooking costs, soap you buy for the dishes, and doing the dishes.

\


Remember this...

\


There is one thing above all that the most successful people on this planet empty their bank accounts for:

\


TIME.\

You've got this man...
