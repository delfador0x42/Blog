# How I Motivate Myself

I don't use hate as a driving force to become a better person.\


Instead, I envision the person I want to become.



I do it based on what people say behind my back.\


For example, when I'm in the gym doing setsâ€¦\


I'm thinking,\


"Have you seen Justin today? He is JACKED."\


It's way more positive than thinking about some guy I want to be better than.\


Put the vision in your mind of how people are going to:\


-Treat you.

-Relate to you.

-Talk about you behind your back.



All in a good way.\


Hate is very fleeting.



I can't get mad at someone and want to work out for six months consistently.\


But I can think,\


"I'm going to get jacked."\


"JUST WAIT until I drop that Instagram photo..."\


Put that in your head.\


It works much better.\
\


You've got this man...
