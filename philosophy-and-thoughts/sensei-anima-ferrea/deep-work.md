# DEEP Work

If you were to isolate yourself for six months and stop everything you were doing,

\


Most of the biggest problems in your life would be handled.

\


A lot of the success in my life has come from when I would leave work and come home...

\


And I'd still be alone.

\


That's when I could really THINK deeply.

\


None of it was negative.

\


A lot of the work you will do is when it's just you and your thoughts.

\


When you learn to be alone,

\


You will realize that you have all the answers inside you.

\


Now ask yourself...

\


Are you silencing your atmosphere enough to hear it?\
\


You've got this man...
