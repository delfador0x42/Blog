# Don't Play Big Boss

If you’re going to be sitting at a table with high-status people…

\


Understanding respect is very important.

\


And understanding the subtleties is what matters the most.

\


Some people don’t see those subtleties because they are ignorant and do it blatantly.

\


This one time, I was at dinner with a guy I respected.

\


His wife was at the table.

\


He told me that he would pay for the dinner.

\


And it’s very rare I’ll let my friends try to pay.

\


Normally, I would slip off and slip off to “the bathroom” and try to pay the bill.

\


But because his wife was at the table, and I respected him…

\


There was no way I would try to play big boss and not let him pay for that dinner.

\


I let him pay for it.

\


Sometimes when people don’t understand respect, hierarchy, or the subtleties of the male ego…

\


They fuck up and say, “I got it,” and flip their AMEX on the table.

\


It’s not the right thing to do as a friend.

\


And it’s certainly a way to piss off influential people.\
\
You’ve got this man…
