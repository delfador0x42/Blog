# Donâ€™t Meditate

I don't meditate.

\


That being said, every morning, I wake up, grab a coffee, and drive.

\


I drive my truck and think for the first hour or two of my day.

\


I address my thoughts about what I will achieve next.

\


I play chess in my mind.

\


People often tell me,

\


"Justin, you're so swift with your decision-making."

\


"You're abrupt and make massive decisions so quickly."

\


In my mind, I say,

\


"I've been playing that move in my head for three months."

\


You are simply seeing it now.

\


Checkmate.

\
You've got this man...
