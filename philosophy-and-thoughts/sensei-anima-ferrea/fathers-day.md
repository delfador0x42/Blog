# Father’s Day

My goal isn’t to be a dad.

\


It’s to be a superhero.

\


Average isn’t an option..

\


Compliant isn’t an option..

\


She will have a magical existence in life..

\


Why?

\


Because I am doing the work to fulfill dreams she doesn’t even have yet.

\


So for those who question if I’d like her to be with a man like me.

\


Fucking right I would..

\


Happy Father’s Day

\


You've got this man...
