# Your Employee F\*cked Up

When you hire people, and they make mistakes…

\


Remember that you must be graceful with them.

\


Yelling at them will never be helpful.

\


The first thing I focus on is intention.

\


I ask myself, "Is this a problem of intention?"

\


When I mention intention, I want to know if they genuinely WANT to do a good job.

\


If I don't believe it's an issue of intention…

\


I approach it with kindness and ask them to devise a plan to ensure the mistake doesn't happen again.

\


This will establish a new system for the business in the future.

\


It prevents anyone else in their position from making the same mistake.

\


However, if the mistake was made despite being part of an existing system…

\


I will question their intention.

\


I only become upset about mistakes that have already occurred.

\


It's important to involve your people in finding solutions.

\


Because they cannot fully embrace something if they don't help build it.

\


You've got this man...
