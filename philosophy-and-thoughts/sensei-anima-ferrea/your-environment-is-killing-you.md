# Your Environment is Killing You

Atmosphere is one of the most important factors that you need to change.

\


I challenge anyone to visit Miami or LA for a weekend...

\


See if it inspires you differently.

\


When you witness a 21-year-old arriving in a Lamborghini...

\


It might provoke thoughts such as:

\


"I can achieve that someday."

\


"I wonder which YouTube channel he's watching."

\


"I'm curious about the business he's involved in to reach that position."

\


While he's refueling his Lamborghini, ask him about his profession.

\


By immersing yourself in a new environment, you gain awareness and consciousness.

\


And if you're too young to experience this, go online.

\


One of the most beautiful aspects of the internet is that it brings everyone together.

\


If you join the Real World and have a group of hustlers supporting you...

\


All you need to do is enter your room and immerse yourself in that world with them.

\


Making money, doing pushups, setting up your room with a desk...

\


You're in that small corner of your room in the metaverse.

\


Transforming your life and distancing yourself from what you shouldn't be doing.



You've got this man...
