# Cast Spells On Yourself

You can cast spells on yourself to become great.

\


I tell myself things that might not even be true.

\


But not believing in them doesn't benefit me.

\


Saying, "I'm the best man in the world"

\


Will undoubtedly boost your confidence.

\


Even if it's not entirely true, you're only part of the way there.

\


Having this kind of faith in yourself is POWERFUL.

\


It's important to have deep faith in yourself.

\


Trusting in yourself will transform you into not only a more confident personâ€¦

\


But a more productive one.\
\


You've got this man...
