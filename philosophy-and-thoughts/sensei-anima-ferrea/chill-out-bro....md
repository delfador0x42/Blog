# Chill Out Bro...

There's never a time to "chill out."

\


My entire life, I plan to work all day everyday.

\


It's kind of like the gym.

\


I never plan a day off.

\


If a day off happens...

\


It's because I let it happen.

\


And that's the good thing about working all the time.

\


It gives you the opportunity to go the Florida Keys with a woman on a Tuesday.

\


The whole time I'm doing that day in the Keys is texting and working the whole damn time.

\


There's no point of having days scheduled off if you're always working.

\


I believe that if you can't be happy on a random Tuesday...

\


Then you really need to address what your life looks like.

\


You've got this man...
