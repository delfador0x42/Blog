# The Most Important Meeting

The most important meeting of the day…

\


GOING TO THE GYM.

\


Anytime I go to the gym, I consider it work.

\


It’s part of the 24 hours of work anyone should be doing.

\


If someone were to call me right now while I'm at the gym, I would tell them,  &#x20;

\


"Sorry, I’m in a meeting."

\


By saying that, I am not lying to them.

\


I’m telling the truth.

\


It’s the most important thing you should do throughout the whole day you are working.

\


So, next time you go out to train, don't look at it as a waste of time.

\


Look at it as building block that feeds the other meetings you will have throughout the day.

\
You've got this man...
