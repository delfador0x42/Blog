# Discipline Runs Out

Discipline is a tool, not a goal state.

\


Because it WILL run out.

\


Instead of chasing discipline, chase positive momentum.

\


Use discipline to gain traction.

\


The traction will get you results.

\


And those results will push you to achieve MORE results.

\


This then snowballs into this massive spiral of wins upon bigger wins.

\


And before you know it, you are standing at the top of the mountain, proudly overlooking what you’ve built.

\


But life isn’t a fairytale...

\


Momentum can be killed almost instantly.

\


You will use discipline to ensure that you don’t stand around enjoying the view.

\


Get your ass back to climbing the next mountain.

\


Comfortability will kill you, and discipline will push you toward the momentum you need to enjoy the climb.\
\


You've got this man...
