# Secret To Negotiation

When people talk about negotiation, they often talk about it as if someone is going to lose.

\


This isn't realistic.

\


Very rarely do I hardball someone and get what I want.

\


Most of the time, it involves creativity.

\


I'm always trying to find a win-win situation in negotiation.

\


As a young guy, I always thought someone had to flat-out win...

\


And someone had to flat-out lose.

\


Real-life business doesn't operate like that.

\


I don't want a lopsided victory in any relationship in my life.

\


Because even if you win a lopsided victory in negation...

\


If you have to continue doing business with that person, it will come up as a rock in their shoe.

\


And they may eventually seek to fuck you over to get even.

\


Or they might opt to leave the deal.

\


Not worth it...\
\


You've got this man...
