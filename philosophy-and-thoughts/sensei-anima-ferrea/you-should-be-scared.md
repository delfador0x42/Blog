# You Should Be Scared

If you're scared, get excited about it...

Because you're growing.

Tim Ferris has this one thing called "fear setting."

It's where you sit down and play out the ABSOLUTE WORST outcome your situation could have.

Then ask yourself,

"Ok, this happened. I was embarrassed, and I'm going to be embarrassed."

"What's the worst that can happen?"

As you continuously break it down in your head…

You conclude it's not that bad if you make a mistake.

Nothing terrible is going to happen except the fact that you're going to grow.

It might take a couple of fuck ups where you crash and burn…

But before you know it, you will eventually knock one out of the park.

Whatever you're about to do that you're scared of is brave.

Don't give a shit.

Go in there with swag, make sure you're super prepared.

If you expect to mess it up, you might accidentally not mess it up.

Go kill it.

If you don’t… fuck it.

Go kill the next one.

You've got this man...
