# Less Is More For Any Man

People often ask me...

Did I ever feel the fear of missing out?

When I was living in a one bed apartment with only a mattress on the ground.

With NOTHING to do.

The answer is that I never felt like I was sacrificing.

I've always thought, "If I do this, this is what will happen to me."

They'll then ask how I mustered up the willpower.

I told them that I wanted to do it.

There was no mustering.

It was already there.

And a lot of that had to do with being sober.

I wasn't drinking.

I wasn't doing any of that shit.

If you're just a natural red-blooded American male...

And you're unhealthy, and you're in good shape...

You won't have the urge to go to a party to drink and have a good time.

All you will want to do is:"

1. Exercise
2. Work
3. Eat
4. Not Drink

Every day and do the same thing over and over again.

It's really that simple.

You've got this man...
