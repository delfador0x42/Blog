# True Leadership

Become a person that people want to get behind.

\


The best way to achieve this is by spending quality time with them.

\


You want to get to a level where you can confidently say,

\


"Hey, that's bullshit."

\


But they still love you even after hearing it.

\


I once took my online, real estate, and construction team to a beach house in Florida.

\


We were situated just 30 yards from the waves on the beach.

\


During those 5-6 days, we all worked and discussed business.

\


It created a stronger bond between my teams, and we had an incredible time together.

\


When your team knows that you care for them,

\


They will trust you enough to engage in honest conversations without having them think that you will fire them.

\


For example, you can send a text message saying,

\


"What are we doing with these calls? This is unacceptable. What's holding us back from getting more?"

\


You are expressing care and addressing your concerns with the business.

\


Another important thing is ensuring they understand that they are in it together.

\


This way, when someone underperforms, you can easily tell them,

\


"These guys suck. Fire them. They're killing us."

\


While emphasizing the "killing us."

\


Doing so allows you to grow collectively as a family.

\


While working together towards a shared goal.\
\


You’ve got this man…
