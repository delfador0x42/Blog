# You Will Evolve

In my 20s, I was solely focused on the man I would become.

\


I was excited about the opportunities that lay ahead.

\


I never dwelt on the times when I was broke.

\


If you find yourself in a similar position, don't view it as if you are trying to escape a cage.

\


Instead, channel your excitement towards where you are going to fly to.

\


Reframing the situation will make you eager to get out of bed daily.

\


If you are experiencing financial difficulties right now, don't get upset.

\


Eventually, you will evolve into the person you have always wanted to become.

\


Fly high G.

\


You've got this man...
