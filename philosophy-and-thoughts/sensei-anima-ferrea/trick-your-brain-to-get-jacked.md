# Trick Your Brain To Get JACKED

I’m a big believer in “shitty workouts.”



Shitty workouts are the mortar that keeps you doing GOOD workouts.\


I lie to myself, by saying “I am going to the gym and doing next to nothing.”\


I’ll then do 2-3 sets and walk out.



BUT 70 to 80% of the time…\


I accidentally get a pump.\


THEN IT’S ON.\


You must understand that you won’t get “jacked” in one day.\


What matters is that you train EVERYDAY.\


“I’ll do a couple of sets.”\


That will turn into consistency over the months and years you lift.\


This leads to results.\


Next thing you know, you look GOOD.\


Then you not only WANT to hit the weights.\


You couldn’t get paid NOT to..\


Try it.\


It WORKS.\

You've got this man...
