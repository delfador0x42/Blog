# Don’t travel the world

There's no benefit to traveling the world when you're young and not making enough money.

\


Instead, start a business IMMEDIATELY.

\


By traveling, all you'll do is go around in hostels and try to sleep with many women.

\


Plus, on top of that…

\


None of your friends you like being around will be able to go with you.

\


I wouldn't have fun traveling without guys like Merlin, Anima Invicta, Thane, Vash, and Ragnar.

\


It would just feel like another town and another hotel room.

\


Making money when you're young is more important.

\


It will excite you more than visiting multiple countries.

\


If you have money saved up, consider investing it in something that will generate more income.

\


You'll learn a lot more from millionaire professors teaching you about business…

\


Then you will be visiting new countries.



\


You've got this man...
