# Your 2 Paths In Life

People tend to take one or two paths in life.

\


They either follow people around them and their surroundingsâ€¦

\


Or they internalize their surroundings and realize what they don't want to be.

\


It's not wrong to follow in the footsteps of people you love, admire, and respect...

\


But often, I find that there is a greater life outside of the home you grew up in.

\


Take this to heart, especially if you grew up in a bad situation.

\


Understand that a difficult upbringing could be your greatest gift.

\


You've got this man...
