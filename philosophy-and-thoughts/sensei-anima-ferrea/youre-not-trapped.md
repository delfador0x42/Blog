Children Are Not A Death Sentence

\


Your life isn't over if you have a child at a young age.

\


It may not be ideal, but it's NOT the end of the world and certainly not your career.

\


You should still take risks.

\


Start businesses, fail at business, succeed at business.

\


If you are doing it right, the mountain of raising a child will become small compared to the income you will make if you take care of your work life.

\


Love your children, mold them.

\


Finally...

\


Never make the mistake of believing your children are a hindrance.

\


Only weak men do this.\
\


You've got this man...
