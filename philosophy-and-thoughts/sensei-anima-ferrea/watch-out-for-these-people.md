# Watch Out For These People

Beware of poor-mouthing.\


People who need a loan today are likely to need one tomorrow.\


If you decide to lend them money…\


Don't consider it a loan;\


Think of it as a gift, as it's unlikely you will ever see that money again.\


Be cautious of those who approach you for money.\


They will come in various forms and with multiple reasons for doing so.\


They often claim it's "not their fault" and shift the blame to someone else for their problems.



Ultimately, you will be the only one left paying.\


I have experienced this with family, friends, coworkers, and employees.\


Trust me when I say that if I were a bank granting loans…



I would be out of business.\


You've got this man...
