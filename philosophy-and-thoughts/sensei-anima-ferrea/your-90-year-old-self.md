# Your 90 Year Old Self

Think about your 90-year-old self.

\


Will he be happy when he looks back at the life he lived?

\


Will he be satisfied with the risks you took?

\


Did you bet on yourself?

\


Or did you put your fate in someone else’s hands?

\


I have had to make many tough decisions…

\


But I never wavered.

\


Because I had the old man whispering in my ear..

\


If not anybody else, I at least had to make him proud.

\


You've got this man...
