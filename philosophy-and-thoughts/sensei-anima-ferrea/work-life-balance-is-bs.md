# Work-Life Balance Is BS

People act like work is a bad word.\


It's the same type of person that says,\


"Don't do business with family."\


They say it because they're too much of a dickhead to get along with anyone that wants to make money.\


For example, Andrew's cousin Luc is family to me.\


I had lunch with him a few weeks ago for about 4 hours.\


That's not lunch.



That's a whole day.\


The only thing we talked about that whole time was WORK.\


I couldn't have been more excited and engaged in the conversation.



What else is supposed to make you feel good about spending time with another man?



It's conquering, making missions, having goals, growing, and helping others.\


Talking about how your day went is LAME.



If we're not making money together, we're not hanging out.\


And a lot of people don't like this statement.



But I don't care.



If we aren't on a journey of conquering and making money togetherâ€¦



Then what the fuck are we doing?\

You've got this man...
