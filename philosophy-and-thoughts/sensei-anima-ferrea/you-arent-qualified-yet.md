# You Aren't Qualified Yet

It's important to have big goals.

\


But you need to realize this...

\


You need to be qualified to achieve those goals within your set timeframe.

\


Because you don't know what challenges you'll encounter as you climb the mountain.

\


When I was 24, I had huge goals for what I wanted my business to look like by the time I turned 30.

\


I was ignorant of the problems I would face and the hurdles I needed to overcome.

\


By the time 30 came around, I was far from my goals.

\


But I was way further ahead than I was at 24.

\


And most importantly, I gained perspective on what it truly takes to be successful.

\


Sure enough, I sailed way past those goals a few years later.

\


Don't be disheartened if you haven't achieved your goals by a certain time.

\


Those goals were set from a point of ignorance.

\


Now that you've played the game, you will understand what it takes to get results.

\


As long as you don't give up, you WILL break through.\
\


You’ve got this man…
