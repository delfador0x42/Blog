# The Island Test

I do an exercise in each business called the “island test.”

Let’s say someone brings you a piece of paper.

And you’re sitting on a deserted island.

This paper has 5 to 15 things you can look at without contact from the outside world.

What 5 to 15 things must you know to ensure your businesses are good and you can stay on that island for another month?

I get this report from all of my businesses every day.

Every day I look at that list and spot the things I do not like.

If I don’t like something, I can make a phone call and find out what it is.

For example, I know:

-How many crews are on the road right now

-How many guys are working.

-Are the guys in front of the schedule?

-If the forklift broke down.

-What’s the occupancy of the apartment buildings?

This daily report helps me understand what’s going on inside my businesses.

It doesn’t take me that long to read this report…

But it gives me an idea of what’s going on and when I need to jump in to help.

This helps me stay on the “island” when I go to places like Spain, Dubai, London, and Los Angeles to do podcasts.

It keeps me involved in our construction and real estate businesses without physically being in the United States.

You've got this man...
