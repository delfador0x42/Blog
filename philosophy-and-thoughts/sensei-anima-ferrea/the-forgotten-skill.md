# The Forgotten Skill

The world doesn't run without guys working in the field.\
\
If construction workers don't turn up at 6 am and get on that roof in the sun...\
\
It doesn't happen.\
\
The one thing we mess up is forgetting the men who help this world go round.\
\
There will be YouTubers one day who say,\
\
"Hey, the new hack is how to roof."\
\
My general superintendent has been putting buildings up since I was born.\
\
He helps put up 200, 300, 400, 800 thousand square foot buildings.\
\
He's not only helping put up metal buildings, he's also training the next generation of guys.\
\
What he does is a dying skill.\
\
It's getting harder for a young man to work with his hands today.\
\
Because he gets on Instagram and feels like he's lost.\
\
I push The Real World, and The Real World is one of the best online schools ever assembled.\
\
If you want to work on the internet, the Real World is the thing to do.\
\
But if a young man likes to work with his hands...\
\
We need to figure out how to make that respectable in society so he gets the positive feedback he deserves.\
\
I respect all the guys who build the country, and I'll never waver from that.\

You've got this man...
