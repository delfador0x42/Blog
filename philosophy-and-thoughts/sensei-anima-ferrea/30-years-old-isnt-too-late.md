# 30 Years Old Isn't Too Late

If you're failing at 30, know this...



Thirty years old is a very young age.\


There's a bunch of people that started businesses 7,8,9,10 years ago that are 32 and just about to find out they will fail.\


Those people might likely start another business tomorrow and knock it out of the park by age 34.\


I can guarantee you that your life is not over.\


And many businesses fail or struggle for a long time...\


Then, a simple pivot causes said business to blow up overnight.\


Giving up in your 30s is the easy way out.\


And honestly, I think you'll be sad that you looked at a young age, like 32...



And Quit.\


Think about the man in the rocking chair when thinking about quitting.



He's going to think,\


"I'm 90 years old and gave up 58 years ago..."



Do you think you're going to be proud of that?\


I believe he will be disgusted.\


It's not too late.



Get rid of the quitter mindset.



It never pays.\


You've got this man...
