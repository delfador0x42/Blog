# Opportunities Exist Everywhere

Anything you do, you can get big in.

You can stripe parking lots.

You can cut grass.

You can become a copywriter.

There are a million ways to skin a cat.

You need to find what you have an affinity for and tough out.

When I first got into metal buildings, I didn’t like it.

What I liked was the business side of it.

Especially estimating because it’s almost like a real estate deal.

There were times when I was going through struggles and losing money.

But I had to suppress the bitch voice.

Until BAM, I made 30 grand in a week…

Then BAM, I made 100 grand in 4 weeks.

Do business that has a high upside.

If you get excited about the money, it won’t matter what space you’re in.

Eventually, you’ll become so competent, so you WON’T have to rely on:

“Passion.”

You've got this man...
