# The New Millionaires

Every new generation will have new opportunities that create new problems.

\


I'll take my dad, for example.

\


A few months ago, he had no idea you could order Uber Eats to the house...

\


And food could show up at the door within 30 minutes.

\


He didn't understand because he grew up in Oxford, Mississippi, farming cotton.

\


Meanwhile, I live in Miami, where everyone does it.

\


If he had the opportunity to use technology in 1982...

\


He would have done the same thing.

\


And for that reason, when I see a kid making tons of money online at 21 years old...

\


I'm not here to judge him.

\


The best thing you can do as a young man is take every new opportunity you see...

\


And act on them FAST.

\


One thing I know is that robots will never replace plumbers.

\


But what I do know is that anyone learning online skills has the chance to become a pioneer of AI.

\


And then five years down the road...

\


You will wonder why everyone complains about millionaires that use AI for their business.

\


Leverage the opportunity of AI&#x20;

\
You've got this man...
