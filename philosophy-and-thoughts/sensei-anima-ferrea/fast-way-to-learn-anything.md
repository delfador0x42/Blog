# Fast Way To Learn ANYTHING

One thing that is important when learning something...

\


Let's say you're reading a book.

\


If you find a word, you need to comprehend and read past it...

\


There is a good chance that you will finish that page and not remember what you read.

\


So, when you're learning, you must pay attention to what you don't understand.

\


Focus not only on the meaning but also on the context in which they are being used.

\


Make sure you define terms as you progress through the process.

\


Any term you need help understanding while learning to do something can prevent you from connecting the dots.

\


Learning is not a linear process...

\


We learn by integrating small pieces and associating them with other concepts.

\


If you're talking to someone, don't be afraid to interrupt the person and ask,

\


"Excuse me, what did that acronym mean?"

\


This will help you comprehend every definition of everything explained...

\


You will discover that you retain everything better.\
\


You've got this man...
