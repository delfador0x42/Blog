# Defining Emotions

Focus is saying no to everything but the priority.&#x20;

Sadness is because you don't know something, so go learn it.

Anxiety is too many options without a priority, picking a priority is removing the alternate options, you need to pick a priority and remove the other options.



Things are not a (is and is not) but a how much. He is patient, he is not patient, should be how patient is he, this is the evidence of how patient.&#x20;

You should do actions that provide evidence to who you want to be.
