# Man on a Mission

Every success is the same.

Rocket scientists, CEOs, President of the USA.

EVERY SUCCESS is the same story.

It's a man on a mission.

The type of man who wakes up every morning with FIRE in his heart.

War-made.

The men who know exactly what they need to do but there's just never enough time to do it all.

Men at war with time and the world.

Highly IRRATIONAL.

The men who will bet their lives on a 20% chance to win because they REFUSE to live without that win.

And every single one of these men knows ONE THING.

On December 26th every winner thinks the same.

Donald Trump tweeted this:

"O.K. Christmas is over, now we can all go back to the wars of life.&#x20;

Focus, focus, focus - never accept defeat - push hard for total victory!" - DJT Dec 26th, 2013

And I said this:

"Whatever your resolutions are, they should have been fixed before Christmas.&#x20;

And if they're not fixed before Christmas,&#x20;

The second best time is NOW.

DOUBLE WORK, DOUBLE TIME, FIGHT"

Every winner is the same.

Christmas is over.

BACK TO THE WARS OF LIFE WHERE WE BELONG.
