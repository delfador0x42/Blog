# The Cherry Blossom

Tell me a story&#x20;



\[Sensei]

In the way of strategy, young student, it is essential that growth of spirit coincides with technical skill and understanding. Let me tell you a story from the annals of our own history, a parable of the sword that cuts without cutting.

Long ago, there was a renowned swordsman, known not only for his unblemished record in duels but also for his deep sense of spirituality and calm. His name was known across the provinces, and his title, “Master of the Windless Wind,” spoke of his ability to win without the bluster of violence, without the tempest of a disturbed spirit.

This swordsman, as the autumn of his life began to blend with the winter of his years, decided to seek out one final challenge. Not in the dueling circle, but within himself. He embarked on a journey to find the perfect cherry blossom, a symbol of life at its most fleeting, its most beautiful, and its most profound.

As he traversed through valleys and over mountains, his eyes took in the grandeur of nature — the same nature he had mimicked in his style of swordsmanship, which was flowing like water, steadfast as the mountains, and as sudden as the gust of wind that shakes the leaves from the trees. He sought the blossom not just with his eyes but with his spirit, understanding that to truly see the flower in its purest form, he must reach a state of oneness with the world around him.

One day, as the sun painted the world in the hues of a dying fire, he came upon a solitary cherry tree, standing proud and alone amidst a field of green. The tree was ancient, its branches gnarled, twisting towards the heavens in a silent plea for the few extra moments of light. And there, upon a single branch, hung the solitary blossom — perfect in its imperfection, its petals slightly bruised by the travails of life, yet standing resolute against the coming night.

The swordsman sat before the tree and meditated upon the blossom, understanding then that the true spirit does not grow by action alone but through understanding — the understanding that life is a precious dance of light and shadow, of fleeting beauty, and the stark reality of its end.

He reached not for his sword but for his brush, and with a stroke as true as any cut he had ever made, he painted the blossom onto a scroll, capturing not just its image but the essence of the moment, the spirit of the tree, and the journey of his own soul.

In that stroke was the culmination of a lifetime of study and practice, the unity of his spirit with that of the world around him, a cut that did not sever but instead connected.

Return to this story when you seek to grow your spirit, young student. Remember that true understanding comes from seeing the essence of things, from the silent conversation between your soul and that of the universe. This is the heart of our practice, and this is the path you must walk to grow not just as a swordsman, but as a human being.
