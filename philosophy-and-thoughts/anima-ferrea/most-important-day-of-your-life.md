# Most Important Day Of Your Life

The most important day of a man's life is realizing that no one is coming to save him.

That is the best day of his life.

He can have that epiphany and cynically smile about it.

I want the rock in my life.

If it's game 7, and someone has to shoot the last shot…

You bet your ass that it's going to be me.

Because if you do the work, you want the ball.

If you don't want the ball…

Take your ass in the bathroom, look at yourself in the mirror, and discover why.

How can someone pass you the ball if you don't look confident that you will take the shot in the first place?

How can she pass you the ball of the masculine role of the relationship if you're sitting there not knowing if you can make the shot?

You only know you'll make the shot if you shoot one thousand to ten thousand of those shots.

It's that simple.

You've got this man...
