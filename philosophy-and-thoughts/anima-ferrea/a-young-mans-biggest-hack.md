# A Young Man's Biggest Hack

One of the biggest hacks as a young man is to have the ability to find a mentor and shut your fucking mouth.

Don’t outshine the master.

Don’t come in there with swag.

You would be SHOCKED at the men that are willing to help you.

As long as you are not wasting their time.

For example, if there is a specific subject like accounting you need help in…

At least have 2 or 3 mentors so you never burn one mentor out.

And there are certain questions you want to ask a smaller mentor when you have smaller problems.

If you have a juggernaut mentor, you want to bring in a juggernaut problem.

Use your mentors wisely.

They’ll change your life.

You've got this man...
