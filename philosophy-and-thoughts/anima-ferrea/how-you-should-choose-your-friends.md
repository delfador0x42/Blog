# How You Should Choose Your Friends

This is how I choose my friends and who I associate myself with.

We all have soles, we just get issued a body.

I got issued, 6 foot 3 white guy living in South Louisiana.

You might have been issued 6 foot black guy living in Oakland.

All I care about is do our soles align.

The responsibility a man has is the same responsibility along the board because other men don’t give a fuck.

You either perform or you don’t.

Regardless of your age, demographic, location…

The rules of being a man are the same.

And the world doesn’t give a shit about anybody’s feelings, all they care about is production.

So you really got to get in there and do the work so you can love yourself.

And there’s a direct reflection of the work you’ve done that will help you love yourself that shines off you like an energy…

That allows the world to love you.

Because you know who you are, and people see what you have accomplished.

You've got this man...
