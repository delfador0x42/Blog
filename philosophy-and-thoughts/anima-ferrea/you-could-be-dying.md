# You Could Be Dying

If you’re not growing you’re dying.

Your soul knows.

I’ve faced this challenge before.

What do you do if you don’t have to work?

It sounds cool to not work a lot, but it isn’t.

It makes you miss being broke.

There were times a couple years ago when I first joined the War Room…

Everything I did, I was still looking at the bank account everyday and my money was going up.

Because I built a money making machine.

But it didn’t feel good.

It was fun, but it was haunting me.

There was a young War Room guy that looked up to me, I let him live in my house for free.

I said to him, “The man that you see is a very unrealistic expectation for what it took for me to get into this position.”

“Don’t believe that this is what it looks like.”

That’s the messed up thing about social media.

It gives you unrealistic expectations of what the real world looks like.

Behind every success story is the struggle that it took to reach it.

Don’t think life is always going to be easy.

You want to get challenged.

You've got this man...
