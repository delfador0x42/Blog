# Demons on a leash

When I was a child, I heard voices. Some would sing and some would scream. You'll soon find you have few choices. I learned the voices died with me. When I was a child, I'd sit for hours, staring into open flames. Something in it had a power, could barely tear my eyes away. All you have is your fire and the place you need to reach. Don't you ever tame your demons, but always keep them on a leash.
