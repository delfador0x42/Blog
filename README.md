&#x20;                   You think that there are some magical devices that you don’t

&#x20;                   know about that make up the internet, but you’d be wrong.

&#x20;                   The internet is essentially workstations, switches, routers,

&#x20;                   and servers. That’s it. Though they be big and small, though

&#x20;                   they have various configurations. That’s it. No magic.

&#x20;                   When thinking about how packets are routed across the

&#x20;                   internet, it can seem quite mysterious when the packet

&#x20;                   crosses your home router, but it really isn’t. There are no

&#x20;                   magical devices past your home router; it’s just more

&#x20;                   routers and switches and servers. The routers have their

&#x20;                   routing tables updated in various ways and servers

&#x20;                   configured for various purposes. But it’s important to stay

&#x20;                   grounded to the real world, and not think about the internet

&#x20;                   as an arcane thing.

&#x20;                   It’s important to keep in mind that every technology used in

&#x20;                   the internet, the various protocols, the various hardware

&#x20;                   devices. Are all essentially solving the same problem. How

&#x20;                   do I get information from point A to point B, regardless of

&#x20;                   whether point A and B are 5 feet apart or 5 million feet

&#x20;                   apart.

&#x20;                   Don’t get lost in the sauce, remember the technology is

&#x20;                   solving an aspect of this problem. How to get information

&#x20;                   from point A to point B. It’s easy to get abstract about

&#x20;                   this stuff but it’s important to stay grounded in how things

&#x20;                   really work, so when you get lost or confused about a

&#x20;                   technology, just think about the problem the technology is

&#x20;                   trying to solve and try to think about how you would solve

&#x20;                   the problem if you were the engineer designing the

&#x20;                   technology. You’ll likely come to the same solution as the

&#x20;                   engineer who made the technology and understand why things

&#x20;                   are the way they are; or you’ll think of another way and are

&#x20;                   then able to compare and contrast solutions, perhaps even

&#x20;                   find a better way. This is in fact how innovation occurs and

&#x20;                   things are done.
