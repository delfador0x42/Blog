# About

### Welcome to My Blog

This is an informal blog where I map out my knowledge, think through my thoughts, and attempt to create a mental model for everything in the world. If you have any suggestions, critiques, or recommendations, I would really appreciate it. I make mistakes, so if I get something wrong, I welcome correction.



**Dojo Section About:**\
The school section is where I attempt to teach you everything I know, in the format I wish I had been taught. Essentially, it’s the dojo—go there to train, young pupil. Though I, too, am a student of Wudan, I have only mastered two of the seven forms. Master Po has instructed me to teach the other disciples so that my own forms may improve and others may learn something in the process.

### Get in Touch

If you have any thoughts or critiques, please email me at nexus0x42@gmail.com.

### About Me

My ultimate goal is to contribute to humanity's conquest of the stars. We have the opportunity in this age to become a multi-planetary species, and I aim to help accelerate that process. Honor God. Train till it kills you. Let's conquer the stars.

### Goal of This Blog

I want a place to think through concepts and build a mental map of how everything works in the world. My aim is to be maximally truthful and accurate. While I will inevitably say wrong things and write inaccuracies, I hope to minimize those as much as possible. Please email me any feedback and criticism – I really appreciate it. I hope that together, we can learn something and bring the day closer when humans become a multi-planetary species.
