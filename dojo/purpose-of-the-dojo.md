# Dojo About Page

**Dojo Section About:**\
The school section is where I attempt to teach you everything I know, in the format I wish I had been taught. Essentially, it’s the dojo—go there to train, young pupil. Though I, too, am a student of Wudan, I have only mastered two of the seven forms. Master Po has instructed me to teach the other disciples so that my own forms may improve and others may learn something in the process.



Remember, the way is in training.
