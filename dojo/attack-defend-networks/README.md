# Attack/Defend Networks

The way is in training. \


When you read and do the exercises build a mental model, constantly test that model with hands on training and experience.&#x20;

### Things we'll build

* We'll build out a corporate network.&#x20;
* We'll build out a model of the entire internet on Earth.&#x20;
* Then we'll attack networks.&#x20;
* Then we'll defend networks.&#x20;
* We'll build some cool malware and offensive implants.&#x20;
* We'll build some cool defensive tools an EDR (blue team implant) and set up a SIEM.&#x20;
* We'll implement some of the network stack (in C)\


You will understand networks and sharpen your blade.&#x20;
