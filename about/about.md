# About

### Welcome to My Blog

This is an informal blog where I map out my knowledge, think through my thoughts, and attempt to create a mental model for everything in the world. If you have any suggestions, critiques, or recommendations, I would really appreciate it. I make mistakes, so if I get something wrong, I welcome correction.

### Get in Touch

If you have any thoughts or critiques, please email me at nexus0x42@gmail.com.

### About Me

My ultimate goal is to contribute to humanity's conquest of the stars. We have the opportunity in this age to become a multi-planetary species, and I aim to help accelerate that process.

### Goal of This Blog

I want a place to think through concepts and build a mental map of how everything works in the world. My aim is to be maximally truthful and accurate. While I will inevitably say wrong things and write inaccuracies, I hope to minimize those as much as possible. Please email me any feedback and criticism â€“ I really appreciate it. I hope that together, we can learn something and bring the day closer when humans become a multi-planetary species.
