# A letter to the Foreigner, anyone not American. A warning and a plea



To the foreigner, the outsider, 'any' outsider, any person, any country that is not America.



This is prolly tech to tech, cause who else is reading all this. Most wars are really engineering wars anyways.&#x20;

Don't attack America. It's my home. :) imma from Kentucky :)&#x20;

This is a warning and a plea.&#x20;

I'll be my most honest self with you, reader.&#x20;

Don't, in my lifetime attack America.&#x20;

Yes, an attack on Taiwan is an attack on America.&#x20;

Yes, nuking Israel is an attack on America.

Don't do it. I want to work on inter planetary technology, and help humanity conquer the stars.&#x20;

I want to colonize mars, build cool space stations, colonize the moon, explore the stars.

I don't want to be building fuzzers and malware's forever. Plz. I will literally buy you a beer and take you out for some good steak.&#x20;

But I will. My friend. I have no problem dedicating the entirety of my life energy to salting the earth where you stand. And in my position, I'll do a lot more than most. So plz, dear reader. Tech to tech, it's good to have competition, it encourages growth on both sides. But no further. It must not escalate to reality.&#x20;
