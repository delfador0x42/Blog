# A letter to my fellow Americans, my brothers. A warning and a plea

To my brethren across the 50 states,



You must become stronger. You live in a clown world. Easy to manipulate. Easy to kill. Real real, read the bible and go to church. Fix yourselves. Then fix your communities. Then fix your states.&#x20;



It's either a close acquaintance with pain and discipline, or church. Though church would lead to the former.&#x20;



This is the only way. Stop whore'ing yourselves out, in both your mind and body. You must focus on training. Let's conquer the stars. And I do not exclude myself when I say all this. But if we do not become a people that honor God, a stronger people. We will all die. There will be no nation.&#x20;
